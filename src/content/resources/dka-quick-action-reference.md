# DKA Quick-Action Reference

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a **medical emergency**. It happens when the body runs out of insulin, causing high glucose, rising ketones, and acidosis.

## ⚠️ Warning Signs
- High glucose **>13.9 mmol/L (250 mg/dL)**
- **Ketones positive** (blood ≥1.5 mmol/L or moderate/large urine)
- Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain
- Deep/fast breathing, fruity breath
- Severe tiredness, confusion, drowsiness

## 🚑 Immediate Actions
- **Do not stop insulin** (always continue basal)
- Check **ketones every 1–2 hours** if glucose stays high
- Take **fluids** — water or sugar-free drinks (sip frequently)
- Give **correction insulin** as per your plan (pen/syringe if pump failure suspected)
- If vomiting or unable to keep fluids down → **urgent medical care**

## 🔺 Red Flags — Go to ED Now
- **Ketones ≥3.0 mmol/L**
- Rising ketones despite correction insulin
- Persistent vomiting or abdominal pain
- Deep/rapid breathing or fruity breath
- Severe drowsiness, confusion, or unconsciousness

## 🧰 Sick-Day Prep Kit
- Blood ketone meter + strips
- Spare insulin pens/syringes
- Glucose meter + strips / CGM
- Oral rehydration drinks, electrolytes
- Copy of your sick-day/DKA plan

⚠️ *This is for education only. Always follow your personal sick-day plan and seek urgent care if DKA is suspected.*
