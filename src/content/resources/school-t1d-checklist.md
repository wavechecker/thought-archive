# Type 1 Diabetes School Staff Checklist

Children with T1D can fully participate in school life when staff understand the basics. Pin this in staff rooms and include in the student’s Diabetes Care Plan (DCP).

---

## ✅ Daily Essentials
- Student has access to **glucose checks, snacks, water, toilets** anytime  
- Know where supplies are: meter/CGM reader, hypo kit, backup insulin/syringe, spare sensors/sets  
- Respect student’s independence if self-managing, but assist if required  

---

## ⚠️ Hypoglycaemia (Low)
**Signs:** shaky, sweaty, pale, irritable, tired, poor concentration  
**Action:**  
1. Give **15–20 g fast carbs** immediately (tabs/gel/juice)  
2. **Recheck in 15 minutes**  
3. Repeat if still low  
4. If unconscious/unable to swallow → **glucagon + emergency services**  

---

## 🔺 Hyperglycaemia (High)
- If glucose >13.9 mmol/L (250 mg/dL) **and unwell** → check ketones  
- Encourage water, follow care plan correction dose  
- For pump users: check infusion set; may need pen/syringe correction  

---

## 🏃 PE / Sports
- Check glucose before activity; keep **fast carbs** close  
- Long/strenuous activity → extra carbs or insulin adjustment per plan  
- Watch for **delayed lows after sport**  

---

## 🚌 Exams, Trips, Camps
- Allow hypo treatment in exams; extra time if needed  
- Take **2x supplies** on trips (meters, strips, ketone strips, infusion sets, glucagon, snacks)  
- Share DCP with trip leaders; locate nearest medical facility  

---

⚠️ *Always follow the student’s individual Diabetes Care Plan. Call emergency services if severe low, unconsciousness, seizure, or signs of DKA.*
