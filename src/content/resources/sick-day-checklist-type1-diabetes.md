# Sick-Day Checklist for Type 1 Diabetes

Being unwell places extra stress on the body. “Sick-day rules” help you manage Type 1 diabetes safely during illness and reduce the risk of serious complications like diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

---

## ✅ Core Rules
- Never stop basal insulin  
- Check blood glucose every 2–4 hours (including overnight if unwell)  
- Check ketones if blood glucose > 13–15 mmol/L or if feeling unwell  
- Follow your personalised sick-day plan if you have one  

---

## 💧 Fluids & Carbohydrates
- Drink water or sugar-free fluids regularly  
- If not eating normally, take in “sick-day carbs” (juice, soft drink, honey, glucose tablets) to avoid ketosis  
- Aim for ~50 g carbohydrate every 3–4 hours if unable to manage regular meals  

---

## 💉 Insulin Adjustments
- Illness can raise insulin needs  
- Use correction doses or temporary basal increases if advised  
- If vomiting or glucose remains high despite extra insulin, contact your diabetes team early  
- Record doses, glucose, ketone results, and fluids taken  

---

## ⚠️ Red Flags — Seek Urgent Medical Care
- Ketones ≥ 3.0 mmol/L, or rising ketones despite insulin and fluids  
- Persistent vomiting or inability to keep fluids down  
- Abdominal pain, rapid breathing, fruity breath, or drowsiness (possible DKA)  
- Severe dehydration (very little urine, extreme thirst, sunken eyes)  

---

## 🧰 Extra Tips
- Keep a **sick-day kit**: ketone strips, glucose tabs, rehydration drinks, thermometer, emergency contacts  
- Tell family/friends about your sick-day plan so they can help if needed  
- Review your plan yearly with your diabetes team
