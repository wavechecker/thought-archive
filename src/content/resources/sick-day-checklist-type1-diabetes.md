# Sick-Day Checklist for Type 1 Diabetes

Being unwell places extra stress on the body. “Sick-day rules” help you manage Type 1 diabetes safely during illness and reduce the risk of serious complications like diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

---

## ✅ Core Rules
- Never stop **basal insulin**  
- Check **blood glucose every 2–4 h** (overnight if unwell)  
- Check **ketones** if BGL > 13–15 mmol/L or if feeling unwell  
- Follow your **personalised sick-day plan** if you have one  

---

## 💧 Fluids & 🍎 Carbohydrates
- Drink water or sugar-free fluids **regularly**  
- If not eating normally, take in “sick-day carbs” (juice, soft drink, honey, glucose tabs)  
- Aim for ~50 g carbohydrate every 3–4 hours if unable to manage regular meals  

---

## 💉 Insulin Adjustments
- Illness can **raise insulin needs**  
- Use **correction doses** or **temporary basal increases** if advised  
- If vomiting or glucose stays high despite extra insulin → **call your diabetes team early**  
- Record doses, glucose, ketone results, and fluids taken  

---

## 🚨 Red Flags — Seek Urgent Medical Care
- Ketones **≥3.0 mmol/L** or rising despite insulin and fluids  
- Persistent **vomiting** or inability to keep fluids down  
- Abdominal pain, rapid breathing, fruity breath, drowsiness (possible **DKA**)  
- Signs of severe dehydration (very little urine, extreme thirst, sunken eyes)  

---

## 🧰 Extra Tips
- Keep a **sick-day kit**: ketone strips, glucose tabs, rehydration drinks, thermometer, emergency contacts  
- Tell family/friends about your sick-day plan so they can help if needed  
- Review your plan yearly with your diabetes team
