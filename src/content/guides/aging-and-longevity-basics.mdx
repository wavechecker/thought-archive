## Intro

This guide is a foundation piece for the Aging & Longevity hub. It will define the basics (aging, lifespan, healthspan), outline what changes biologically with age, and clarify what we can and can’t currently influence.

## Key Points

- **Aging** is biological decline over time, not just “getting older.”
- **Lifespan** and **healthspan** are related but not the same.
- Genetics and environment both contribute; neither tells the full story alone.
- Most “longevity” advice is really about reducing disease risk and preserving function.

## Background

*Stub: expand with a clear explanation of aging biology, major age-related disease categories, and why risk rises with age.*

## What changes with age

*Stub: expand with high-level systems overview (cardiometabolic, immune, musculoskeletal, brain).*

## What longevity research is trying to do

*Stub: interventions, biomarkers, slowing aging vs delaying disease.*

## FAQ

**Q: What is aging?**  
A: Aging is the gradual decline in physiological function over time, increasing vulnerability to disease and death.

**Q: Lifespan vs healthspan?**  
A: Lifespan is total years lived. Healthspan is years lived in good function and low disease burden.

**Q: Is aging mostly genes or lifestyle?**  
A: Both. Genes shape predisposition; lifestyle/environment influences how it plays out.
