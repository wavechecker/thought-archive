# Measles Vaccine

## Intro
The measles vaccine is one of the most effective vaccines ever developed. It prevents measles, a highly contagious viral disease that can cause pneumonia, encephalitis, blindness, and death. Widespread vaccination has dramatically reduced global measles mortality and remains critical for outbreak prevention.

## Key Points
- **Effectiveness:** ~97% protection after two doses.  
- **Impact:** Prevents an estimated 23 million deaths globally between 2000 and 2018.  
- **Formulation:** Often given as the combined MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) or MMRV (with varicella) vaccine.  
- **Safety:** Decades of data confirm safety; side effects are usually mild and temporary.  

## Background
- **Development:** The first measles vaccine was licensed in 1963. Improved versions quickly followed, with widespread use by the 1970s.  
- **Global adoption:** Included in nearly all national immunisation schedules.  
- **Elimination campaigns:** WHO has set elimination goals multiple times; while progress is strong, gaps in coverage still allow outbreaks.  

## Evidence
- **Effectiveness:** Two-dose programs achieve herd immunity when >90–95% of children are vaccinated.  
- **Population data:** Countries with high coverage (e.g., US, Australia, EU) have eliminated endemic measles. Outbreaks occur when vaccination rates dip.  
- **Safety monitoring:** Decades of surveillance (VAERS, AusVaxSafety, EudraVigilance) confirm no link to autism or chronic illness.  

## Risks / Benefits
- **Benefits:** Protection against a disease with a case fatality rate of ~1–3 per 1,000 in developed countries, higher in low-resource settings. Prevents complications such as encephalitis, deafness, and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE).  
- **Risks:** Most side effects are mild (fever, rash, sore arm). Rarely, febrile seizures or temporary low platelet count occur. Serious allergic reactions are extremely rare.  
- **Debunked myths:** Claims linking MMR to autism stem from a fraudulent 1998 paper that has been retracted and widely disproven.  

## Global Recommendations
- **WHO:** Recommends two doses for all children, first at 9–12 months and the second at 15–18 months (timing varies by country).  
- **CDC (US):** First dose at 12–15 months, second at 4–6 years.  
- **ATAGI (Australia):** Two doses via the National Immunisation Program: first at 12 months (MMR), second at 18 months (MMRV).  

## FAQ
**Q: How many doses are needed for lifelong protection?**  
A: Two doses provide >95% protection and usually lifelong immunity.  

**Q: Can adults get vaccinated?**  
A: Yes. Adults without documented immunity should receive at least one dose, especially before international travel.  

**Q: Why do outbreaks still occur if vaccines work?**  
A: Measles is so contagious (R0 ≈ 12–18) that even small drops in coverage allow outbreaks. Vaccine coverage must remain very high.
