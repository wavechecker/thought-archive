## Intro
Chronic back pain (lasting >12 weeks) is common and usually not caused by something dangerous. Most people improve with time, movement, and targeted self-care. The goal is to reduce pain, improve function, and prevent flares.

## Key Points
- **Keep moving** within comfort; bed rest makes pain worse long-term.  
- Look for **red flags** (below) that need medical assessment.  
- Combine **exercise + education + pacing**; add meds or procedures only if needed.  
- Mood, sleep, and stress strongly influence pain—treat the whole picture.

## Common Causes
- Non-specific mechanical pain (most cases).  
- Degenerative changes (disc, facet joints).  
- Radicular pain / **sciatica** (nerve irritation).  
- Less common: spinal stenosis, inflammatory arthritis, vertebral fracture.

## Red Flags — Seek Medical Review
- Recent major trauma; **unexplained weight loss**; **fever**; history of **cancer**; **IV drug use**; **night pain** not eased by rest.  
- **Neurologic deficits**: new weakness, numbness in the saddle area, loss of bladder/bowel control → **urgent care** (possible cauda equina).

## Self-Care & Rehab
- **Activity:** Walk daily; avoid prolonged sitting. Gradually resume normal tasks.  
- **Exercise therapy:** Core strengthening, hip mobility, and graded aerobic work (physio program or reputable app).  
- **Pacing:** Break tasks into chunks; avoid boom-bust cycles.  
- **Heat/ice:** Short sessions can ease symptoms.  
- **Sleep:** Aim for consistent schedule; supportive mattress/pillow.  
- **Weight, smoking, stress:** Address contributors that sensitize pain pathways.

## Medications (use judiciously)
- **First line:** Paracetamol/acetaminophen can help some; short courses of **NSAIDs** if appropriate.  
- **Avoid routine opioids**; consider only short-term in select cases under clinician guidance.  
- **Neuropathic agents** (e.g., duloxetine) may help specific patterns; discuss risks/benefits.

## When to Consider Imaging or Procedures
- Imaging (MRI) **not needed** initially unless red flags or persistent disabling pain after conservative care.  
- **Injections** (e.g., epidural) may help short-term in radicular pain; benefit is often temporary.  
- **Surgery** is reserved for specific conditions (severe stenosis, persistent sciatica with deficits) after non-surgical options fail.

## Flare Plan
1. Dial back intensity, **not** to zero—keep gentle movement.  
2. Use heat/ice and short course NSAIDs if suitable.  
3. Resume rehab exercises as pain settles.  
4. If not improving after 1–2 weeks or red flags appear, seek review.

## FAQ
**Do I need an MRI?**  
Usually no. Imaging often shows “abnormalities” that are normal with age and don’t change treatment.

**Is bed rest good for flares?**  
No—brief rest is okay, but extended rest slows recovery.

**Can stress really worsen back pain?**  
Yes. Stress, low mood, and poor sleep amplify pain signals; managing them helps pain control.
