## Intro
**Nipah virus (NiV)** is a rare but extremely dangerous zoonotic virus that causes severe brain inflammation (encephalitis) and respiratory illness in humans. It is classified as a biosafety level-4 pathogen and is associated with some of the highest case-fatality rates of any known infectious disease.

There is currently **no approved vaccine or curative treatment**.

---

## Key Points
- Reported fatality rates commonly range from **40–75%**
- Natural reservoir: fruit bats (*Pteropus* species)
- Transmission includes **human-to-human spread**
- Rapid neurological deterioration is common
- Survivors may experience long-term or delayed neurological effects

---

## Background
Nipah virus was first identified in 1998–1999 during an outbreak among pig farmers in Malaysia. Since then, repeated outbreaks have occurred primarily in Bangladesh and eastern India, often linked to bat-to-human spillover events.

The virus belongs to the *Henipavirus* genus and is closely related to Hendra virus.

---

## Transmission
Nipah virus spreads through:
- Consumption of food contaminated by fruit bats (notably raw date palm sap)
- Contact with infected animals (such as pigs)
- Close contact with infected humans via bodily fluids, including respiratory secretions

Human-to-human transmission has been documented in multiple outbreaks, particularly in healthcare and household settings.

---

## Symptoms
### Early symptoms
- Fever
- Headache
- Muscle pain
- Vomiting
- Sore throat

### Severe disease
- Drowsiness and confusion
- Seizures
- Acute encephalitis
- Respiratory distress
- Rapid progression to coma

Death may occur within days of neurological onset.

---

## Diagnosis
Diagnosis relies on:
- RT-PCR testing of blood, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, or respiratory samples
- Serological testing in later stages
- MRI imaging, which often shows characteristic encephalitic changes

Testing is typically performed in specialised reference laboratories.

---

## Treatment
There is **no proven antiviral therapy** for Nipah virus infection.

Management consists of intensive supportive care, including:
- Airway and respiratory support
- Seizure control
- Management of raised intracranial pressure
- Strict infection-control measures

---

## Prognosis
Even with modern intensive care, mortality remains high. Some survivors develop:
- Persistent neurological deficits
- Personality or cognitive changes
- Delayed relapse encephalitis months or years after recovery

---

## FAQ

**Q: Is Nipah virus airborne?**
A: There is no evidence of long-range airborne transmission. Spread occurs through close contact and exposure to bodily fluids.

**Q: Why is Nipah virus closely monitored?**
A: Because of its high lethality, ability to spread between humans, and lack of vaccines or curative treatments.
