## Intro
Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a **medical emergency** caused by insufficient insulin leading to high blood glucose and acidic blood. It develops over hours and needs **urgent hospital treatment**.

## Key Points
- Think DKA if **high glucose + positive ketones + symptoms** (nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, deep breathing, dehydration).
- **Do not delay**: give correction insulin, drink fluids, and **seek urgent care** if ketones remain high or you’re vomiting.
- Pump users: suspect **site/tubing failure** first.

## Red Flags — Go to ED Now
- **Blood ketones ≥3.0 mmol/L** (or moderate/large urine ketones).  
- **Persistent vomiting**, severe abdominal pain, **drowsiness/confusion**, **fast/deep breathing** (Kussmaul), **fruity breath**, or **unable to keep fluids down**.  
- Child, pregnancy, or significant illness → **lower threshold** to attend ED.

## Home Assessment (If Not Yet in Distress)
1. **Check glucose** and **blood ketones** (preferred) or urine ketones.  
2. **Hydrate**: small frequent sips of water/electrolytes.  
3. **Inspect pump** (if using): check site, tubing, occlusions; change set and give a **pen/syringe correction** if needed.

## Quick Action Table

| Situation | What to do at home (while arranging care) |
|---|---|
| Glucose >13.9 mmol/L (>250 mg/dL) **and** ketones 0.6–1.4 | Take **correction insulin** per plan; drink fluids; recheck ketones in **1–2 h**. |
| Ketones 1.5–2.9 | **Extra insulin** per sick-day plan (often 10–20% of total daily dose or 0.1 u/kg; follow your clinician’s plan); fluids; recheck **hourly**. |
| Ketones ≥3.0 or any vomiting/abdominal pain/drowsiness | **ED now.** Give correction insulin if advised, **do not** delay travel. |

> Always follow your personalized **sick-day rules**; numbers above are common frameworks but vary by clinic.

## Common Triggers
- Missed insulin doses or **pump/site failure**.  
- Infection/illness, dehydration.  
- New-onset type 1 diabetes.

## In the Emergency Department — What to Expect
- Blood tests: glucose, ketones, electrolytes, blood gases.  
- **IV fluids**, **insulin infusion**, and **electrolyte (potassium) replacement**.  
- Treatment of underlying cause (infection, pump failure).  
- Frequent monitoring until ketones clear and you can switch to usual insulin.

## Prevention
- **Sick-day plan** written and accessible.  
- Keep **backup pens/syringes** even if you use a pump.  
- Check **ketones** whenever glucose is high **and** you feel unwell.  
- Change infusion sets regularly; carry spares and inspect for leaks.

## FAQ
**Can I exercise to lower high glucose with ketones?**  
No. Exercise can **worsen ketones** when insulin is low.

**I took a correction but ketones won’t drop.**  
Suspect pump/site failure—**inject** with a pen/syringe and **seek care**.

**Does DKA happen in type 2?**  
Less common, but possible—especially in ketosis-prone T2 or with SGLT2 inhibitors (then called **euglycaemic DKA**).
