## Intro

Large language models (LLMs) generate human-like text by predicting patterns in language.

In healthcare, they are increasingly used for:

- Drafting clinical documentation
- Summarizing medical research
- Generating patient education materials
- Assisting with differential diagnosis brainstorming

Their capabilities are expanding rapidly.

Their limitations are equally important.

---

## Key Points

- LLMs generate text based on pattern recognition, not true understanding.
- They can produce fluent but incorrect information.
- Some clinical uses are regulated; many are not.
- Confidence in output does not equal accuracy.
- Human oversight remains essential.

## How LLMs Are Used in Healthcare

### 1. Clinical Documentation
LLMs can draft encounter notes and discharge summaries, reducing administrative burden.

### 2. Research Summarization
They can synthesize large volumes of medical literature quickly.

### 3. Patient Communication
LLMs help generate plain-language explanations.

### 4. Diagnostic Support
Some systems assist clinicians in generating differential diagnoses.

Each use case carries different risk levels.

## Strengths

LLMs can:

- Process vast amounts of text quickly
- Generate structured summaries
- Translate technical language
- Assist with administrative efficiency

They may reduce documentation time and cognitive load.

---

## Limitations

LLMs may:

- Hallucinate (produce incorrect but plausible information)
- Reflect training data biases
- Lack real-time verification of claims
- Present uncertainty poorly

They do not “know” facts.

They predict text based on patterns.

---

## Performance vs Clinical Outcomes

Many evaluations of LLMs focus on:

- Medical exam performance
- Benchmark datasets
- Accuracy in simulated tasks

Strong exam performance does not automatically translate into improved real-world patient outcomes.

---

## Regulation and Boundaries

If an LLM directly influences diagnosis or treatment, it may be classified as a medical device.

If used purely for documentation or education, it may not be regulated as such.

The boundary between support tool and clinical decision system is evolving.

- [AI in Medicine: Evidence Standards](/guides/ai-in-medicine-evidence-standards)

---

## Automation Bias Risk

Because LLMs produce fluent and confident answers, they may increase automation bias.

See:

- [Automation Bias in Clinical Practice](/guides/automation-bias-in-clinical-practice)

Confidence is persuasive.

Accuracy must be independently verified.

## FAQ

**Q: Can LLMs diagnose disease?**  
A: They can generate differential suggestions but are not substitutes for clinical evaluation.

**Q: Are LLMs regulated like medical devices?**  
A: Only if used in ways that directly influence clinical decisions.

**Q: Should patients trust AI-generated health advice?**  
A: AI information can be helpful, but professional medical guidance remains essential.
