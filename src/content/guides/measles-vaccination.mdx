faq:
  - q: "How effective is the measles vaccine?"
    a: "Protection is strong: around 93% after one dose and around 97% after two doses of MMR."
  - q: "Do adults need an MMR booster?"
    a: "Many adults do not need a booster if they have evidence of immunity (two documented doses, lab evidence, or prior infection). Some situations (outbreaks, travel, healthcare work) may require updated proof or vaccination."
  - q: "Does MMR cause autism?"
    a: "No. Large studies show no link between MMR and autism. The original claim was fraudulent and retracted."

# Measles Vaccine (MMR/MMRV)

## Intro
The measles vaccine is usually given as **MMR** (measles, mumps, rubella) or **MMRV** (MMR + varicella). It's a core tool for preventing measles outbreaks.

For the broader illness overview, see **[Measles (Rubeola)](/guides/measles)**.

## Key Points
- **Two doses** provide strong protection for most people
- Communities typically need **~95% two-dose coverage** to prevent sustained outbreaks
- Catch-up vaccination is common and usually straightforward
- Serious vaccine reactions are **rare**

## Risk Stratification

**Who Should Review Their MMR Status Now:**

**High priority:**
- Unvaccinated or unknown vaccine status
- International travel planned

**Medium priority:**
- Healthcare / childcare / crowded settings
- Only one documented dose

**Low priority (but stay informed):**
- Two documented MMR doses

## What the Vaccine Prevents
MMR protects against:
- **Measles** (rubeola) — highly contagious; can cause pneumonia/encephalitis
- **Mumps** — salivary gland swelling; complications can occur
- **Rubella** — mild in many, but dangerous in pregnancy

## Routine Schedule
Schedules vary by country, but commonly include:
- **Dose 1** in early childhood
- **Dose 2** later in childhood (often before school)

  <h3>Local schedules differ</h3>
  <p>Use your country's official immunization schedule for exact ages and catch-up intervals. The key concept is <strong>2 documented doses</strong> for most people.</p>

## Catch-Up Vaccination
Consider catch-up if:
- You never received MMR
- You received only one dose
- You can't find records and don't have proof of immunity

In many settings, clinicians treat "no records" as "not vaccinated" and proceed with catch-up vaccination.

## Outbreak Situations
During outbreaks, public health advice may include:
- Accelerating second doses for eligible children
- Vaccinating susceptible adults
- Targeted vaccination in schools, shelters, or high-risk communities

## Effectiveness
Typical effectiveness estimates:
- **~93%** after one dose
- **~97%** after two doses

Breakthrough cases tend to be **milder** and less likely to spread.

## Safety and Side Effects
Common short-term effects:
- Sore arm, mild fever, mild rash
Less common:
- Temporary joint aches (more common in adults)

Serious reactions are rare. If you have a history of severe allergy to a vaccine component, discuss with a clinician.

## Who Should NOT Get MMR
MMR is a **live attenuated vaccine**, so it is usually avoided in:
- **Pregnancy**
- **Severe immunocompromise** (case-by-case)

## FAQ
**Q: If I had measles as a child, do I still need MMR?**
A: Natural infection usually provides strong immunity, but documentation can be unclear. A clinician can advise based on records and local guidance.

**Q: Can I get MMR if I'm not sure I had it?**
A: Often yes — when in doubt and there are no contraindications, vaccination may be recommended.

**Q: Is it safe to get an extra dose?**
A: In many cases, an additional dose is acceptable when documentation is missing, but confirm with a clinician.
