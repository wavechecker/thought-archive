## Intro
Osteoporosis is a disease that weakens bones, making them fragile and more likely to break.  
Often called a “silent disease,” it usually shows no symptoms until a fracture occurs.  
It affects millions worldwide and is a major cause of disability in older adults.

## Key Points
- Osteoporosis = reduced bone density and fragile structure.  
- Most common in women after menopause, but also affects men.  
- Often detected only after a fracture.  
- Diagnosed with bone density scans (DEXA).  
- Treatments reduce bone loss and fracture risk; lifestyle measures help prevent progression.  

## Signs and Symptoms
- Usually no symptoms until a fracture occurs.  
- Common fracture sites: hip, spine, wrist.  
- Spine fractures may cause height loss, stooped posture, or back pain.  
- Hip fractures often lead to loss of mobility and independence.  

## Causes and Risk Factors
- **Hormonal changes:** estrogen loss after menopause, low testosterone in men.  
- **Aging:** bone remodeling slows with age.  
- **Family history:** higher risk if a parent had fractures.  
- **Lifestyle:** smoking, alcohol, inactivity, poor diet.  
- **Medical conditions:** rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, thyroid disease.  
- **Medications:** long-term steroids (glucocorticoids).  

## Diagnosis
- **Bone density scan (DEXA):** the gold standard test.  
  - T-score –1.0 to –2.5 = osteopenia (low bone mass).  
  - T-score ≤ –2.5 = osteoporosis.  
- **Fracture history:** low-impact fractures raise suspicion.  
- **Blood tests:** may be done to rule out other causes.  

## Treatment

**Lifestyle and prevention:**  
- **Weight-bearing exercise:** walking, stair climbing, dancing.  
- **Resistance training:** improves bone strength and muscle support.  
- **Balance and flexibility training:** tai chi, yoga — reduce fall risk.  
- Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake.  
- Avoid smoking and limit alcohol.  
- Home safety measures to prevent falls.  

**Medications:**  
- **Bisphosphonates (alendronate, risedronate, zoledronic acid):** most common first-line therapy.  
- **Denosumab:** injection given every 6 months.  
- **Hormone-related therapies:** estrogen therapy or SERMs for some women.  
- **Anabolic drugs:** teriparatide and romosozumab may be used in severe cases to build bone.  

## Risks and Prognosis
- Fracture risk rises sharply with untreated osteoporosis.  
- Hip and spine fractures carry the greatest risk of disability and death.  
- With treatment, bone loss can be slowed, fracture risk reduced, and quality of life maintained.  

## FAQ
**Q: Who should get screened?**  
A: Women over 65, men over 70, and younger people with risk factors or prior fractures.  

**Q: Can osteoporosis be reversed?**  
A: Bone density can be improved with some treatments, but full reversal is uncommon. The main goal is reducing fracture risk.  

**Q: Is it only a women’s disease?**  
A: No — men are also affected, particularly with age or certain medical conditions.  

**Q: What’s the difference between osteoporosis and osteopenia?**  
A: Osteopenia is “low bone mass” (mild bone loss). Osteoporosis is more severe and carries a higher fracture risk.
