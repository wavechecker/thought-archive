## Intro
Insect-borne (vector-borne) infections are illnesses spread by mosquitoes, ticks, fleas, and other arthropods. They include Lyme disease, dengue, malaria, West Nile virus, and others.

## Key Points
- Insects act as “vectors” that carry pathogens between animals and humans.  
- Risk depends on geography, season, and outdoor exposure.  
- Prevention focuses on avoiding bites and controlling vectors.  
- Some infections are vaccine-preventable; most rely on behavioural measures.  

## Background
Climate change, travel, and land-use patterns are expanding the range of many vectors. Understanding basic prevention strategies matters for travellers and residents in endemic areas.

## Causes or Mechanisms
Vectors can transmit:
- Bacteria (e.g. *Borrelia burgdorferi* via ticks)  
- Parasites (e.g. *Plasmodium* malaria via mosquitoes)  
- Viruses (e.g. dengue, Zika, West Nile via mosquitoes)  

## Diagnosis / Treatment / Options
Diagnosis varies by pathogen and usually combines clinical assessment with targeted blood tests. Treatment ranges from oral antibiotics (Lyme) to antimalarials, antivirals, or supportive care.

## Risks / Benefits / Prognosis
Outcomes depend on the infection, access to care, and underlying health. Prevention through bite avoidance and, where available, vaccines is often more effective than treatment after the fact.

## FAQ
**Q: Are all tick bites dangerous?**  
A: No. Only some ticks carry pathogens. Risk depends on local prevalence, tick species, and attachment duration.

**Q: Do I need testing after every insect bite?**  
A: No. Most bites are harmless. Testing is guided by symptoms, exposure history, and local disease patterns.
