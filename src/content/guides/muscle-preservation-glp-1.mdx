## Intro
GLP-1 drugs promote major weight loss — but some of that loss can include **lean muscle**, especially in adults over 40. This guide explains how to prevent sarcopenia while using Ozempic, Wegovy, or Mounjaro.

---

## Key Points
- GLP-1 drugs reduce appetite so much that protein intake drops.
- Without resistance training, 20–40% of weight lost can come from muscle.
- Strength training + high protein = the antidote.
- Creatine is safe, supported by decades of data, and highly useful.
- Muscle preservation is crucial for healthy aging and long-term metabolic health.

## Background
Muscle is metabolically active tissue essential for:
- glucose control  
- balance & falls prevention  
- metabolic rate  
- healthy aging  

GLP-1 drugs don’t target muscle directly; muscle loss comes indirectly from:
1. lower protein intake  
2. lower calorie intake  
3. reduced mechanical loading

## How to Protect Muscle (Evidence-Based)

### 1. Protein Target
Aim for **1.6–2.2 g/kg/day** of body weight.  

If appetite is low, prioritise:
- protein shakes  
- Greek yogurt  
- eggs  
- lean meats  
- cottage cheese  

Consider **front-loading** protein earlier in the day while appetite is higher.

### 2. Resistance Training
Minimum:  
- **3 sessions/week**  
- Focus on compound lifts: squats, deadlifts, pressing, rows.  
- Progressively overload (heavier, more reps, or slower tempo).  

Key principles:
- Train close to technical failure  
- Use full range of motion  
- Allow recovery days between heavy sessions  

### 3. Creatine
- **3–5 g/day**, no cycling needed  
- Improves strength and reduces muscle loss during caloric deficits  
- Mix with water, juice, or a protein shake  

### 4. Daily Movement (Steps)
Baseline: **8,000–10,000 steps/day**.  
This maintains NEAT (non-exercise calories burned) and supports insulin sensitivity.

### 5. Supplements (Optional)
- Vitamin D (if low)  
- Omega-3 (anti-inflammatory effects, joint support)  
- Magnesium (sleep and recovery)  
- Electrolytes (important with low appetite or GI side effects)

## Risks / Signs of Muscle Loss
Watch for:
- **Rapid weight drop** (>1 kg/week)  
- **Weakness or fatigue** during daily activities  
- **Declining strength** on familiar lifts  
- Poor recovery from normal workouts  
- “Skinny-fat” appearance (smaller but softer)  

If these occur:
- Increase calories slightly (especially protein)  
- Reduce the pace of weight loss  
- Confirm that you’re lifting with enough intensity  
- Discuss potential dose adjustments with your prescriber

## FAQ

**Q: Can I build muscle while on Ozempic?**  
Yes — if protein and training are sufficient. You may need to be more deliberate about calories and strength progression.

**Q: Is creatine safe with GLP-1s?**  
Yes. There are no known direct contraindications. As always, check with your clinician if you have kidney disease or other concerns.

**Q: Should older adults train differently?**  
Yes — focus on:
- slower, controlled lifts  
- balance and coordination  
- fall-prevention exercises  
- slightly longer rest periods  

**Q: How fast is “too fast” for weight loss?**  
More than **0.5–1% of body weight per week** increases the risk of lean mass loss.
