## Intro
The respiratory system is essential for delivering oxygen to the body and removing carbon dioxide. When breathing is disrupted, it can affect energy, sleep, and even heart health.

## Key Points
- Asthma, COPD, sleep apnoea, shortness of breath, and wheezing are the most common respiratory concerns.  
- Shortness of breath and night-time wheezing are **red-flag symptoms** that can signal serious disease.  
- These conditions often overlap with heart and circulation issues.  
- Lifestyle changes and early treatment improve outcomes significantly.  

## Common Respiratory Conditions
- [Asthma](/guides/asthma) — chronic airway inflammation and wheezing.  
- [COPD](/guides/copd) — progressive airway obstruction, usually smoking-related.  
- [Sleep Apnoea](/guides/sleep-apnoea) — breathing interruptions during sleep.  
- [Shortness of Breath](/guides/shortness-of-breath) — a key warning sign across many conditions.  
- [Wheezing & Night-time Breathlessness](/guides/wheezing-night-time-breathlessness) — symptom guide to distinguish asthma, sleep apnoea, and heart causes.  

## FAQ
**Q: What conditions affect the respiratory system?**  
A: Asthma, COPD, sleep apnoea, lung infections, shortness of breath, and wheezing are among the most common respiratory problems.  

**Q: When should I see a doctor for breathing issues?**  
A: If you experience sudden, severe, or unexplained shortness of breath, wheezing, chest pain, or coughing up blood, seek urgent medical help.  

**Q: Can lifestyle changes improve respiratory health?**  
A: Yes. Avoiding smoking, reducing allergens, exercising, and keeping a healthy weight all support lung function.
