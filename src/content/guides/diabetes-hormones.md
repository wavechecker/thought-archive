## Intro
Diabetes affects not only blood sugar but also broader hormone systems, influencing metabolism, reproductive health, and cardiovascular function.

## Key Points
- Diabetes disrupts insulin regulation and can alter other hormones, including testosterone.  
- Men with diabetes are at higher risk for low testosterone and erectile dysfunction.  
- Hormonal balance is central to long-term diabetes management.  

## Background
Insulin is a master hormone for energy balance. In diabetes, insulin dysfunction alters the interplay between blood sugar, fat storage, reproductive hormones, and stress hormones.

## Causes or Mechanisms
- **Type 1 diabetes**: autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing beta cells.  
- **Type 2 diabetes**: insulin resistance with relative insulin deficiency.  
- **Hormonal interplay**: high blood sugar and obesity can reduce testosterone; low testosterone worsens insulin resistance.  

## Diagnosis / Treatment / Options
- **Diagnosis**: blood glucose (fasting, HbA1c), plus hormonal testing in symptomatic men.  
- **Treatment**: blood sugar control with insulin or oral agents; testosterone replacement may be considered if confirmed low.  
- **Lifestyle**: weight loss, exercise, and improved sleep can normalize hormone levels.  

## Risks / Prognosis
- Poorly controlled diabetes increases risk of cardiovascular disease, neuropathy, kidney damage, and hormonal imbalance.  
- Optimizing both glucose and hormone balance improves prognosis and quality of life.  

## FAQ
**Q: Does diabetes cause low testosterone?**  
A: Men with type 2 diabetes often have lower testosterone due to obesity, insulin resistance, and vascular damage.  

**Q: Can TRT help diabetes?**  
A: TRT may improve insulin sensitivity in some men but should be used cautiously and under medical supervision.  

**Q: Does insulin therapy affect testosterone?**  
A: Insulin itself doesnâ€™t lower testosterone, but diabetes-related metabolic changes often do.
