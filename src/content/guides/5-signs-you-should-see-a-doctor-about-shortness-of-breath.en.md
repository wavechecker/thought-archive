# 5 Signs You Should See a Doctor About Shortness of Breath

## Overview
Shortness of breath (also called dyspnea) can range from mild and temporary to a sign of a serious medical problem. While it’s common to feel winded after exercise or high altitude, certain warning signs mean you should seek medical attention quickly.

## Key Points
- Mild breathlessness can be normal — but persistent or sudden shortness of breath is not.
- Severe cases can indicate heart or lung problems.
- Don’t ignore breathlessness if it’s new, worsening, or accompanied by other symptoms.

## Sign #1 — Sudden Onset Without Explanation
If shortness of breath comes on abruptly — especially at rest — it can be a sign of:
- Pulmonary embolism (blood clot in the lungs)
- Heart attack
- Severe asthma attack

## Sign #2 — Chest Pain or Pressure
Breathlessness combined with chest discomfort can indicate:
- Heart attack
- Angina
- Pericarditis (inflammation around the heart)

## Sign #3 — Blue Lips or Fingertips
A bluish color (cyanosis) means your blood isn’t getting enough oxygen. This requires urgent medical evaluation.

## Sign #4 — Severe Wheezing or Stridor
High-pitched sounds when breathing can signal:
- Severe asthma
- Allergic reaction
- Airway obstruction

## Sign #5 — Worsening Breathlessness Over Days or Weeks
If your breathing is gradually getting worse:
- Could indicate worsening COPD, heart failure, or lung disease.
- May be linked to anemia or infections like pneumonia.

## When to Call Emergency Services
Seek help immediately if you:
- Cannot speak more than a few words without gasping.
- Feel faint or confused.
- Have swelling in your legs with sudden breathlessness.
