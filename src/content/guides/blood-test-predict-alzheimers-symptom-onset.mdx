## Introduction

A 2026 study published in *Nature Medicine* explored whether a single blood test could estimate **not just whether Alzheimer's disease biology is present — but when symptoms are likely to begin**.

**Primary source:** [Petersen KK et al. *Predicting onset of symptomatic Alzheimer's disease with plasma p-tau217 clocks*. Nature Medicine (2026).](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-026-04206-y)

Researchers used a plasma biomarker called **%p-tau217** and built mathematical "clock models" to estimate:

- The age when a person likely became biomarker-positive
- The number of years until cognitive symptoms might develop

This represents a shift from binary testing ("positive or negative") toward **biological time staging**.

---

## What Is %p-tau217?

Tau is a protein that stabilizes neurons. In Alzheimer's disease, tau becomes abnormally phosphorylated.

**%p-tau217** measures:

> The proportion of tau protein phosphorylated at position 217 relative to total tau.

It strongly correlates with:

- Amyloid PET imaging
- Tau PET imaging
- Cognitive decline

Because it can be measured from blood, it is far more accessible than brain imaging.

## What Is an Alzheimer's "Clock Model"?

<ClockTheoryBox />

Traditional risk models rely heavily on chronological age.

Clock models instead attempt to estimate **biological time** by:

1. Identifying when a biomarker crosses a positivity threshold.
2. Aligning individuals by "years since biomarker positivity."
3. Modeling when symptoms typically emerge after that biological event.

Two methods were used in the study:

- **TIRA** (Temporal Integration of Rate Accumulation)
- **SILA** (Sampled Iterative Local Approximation)

Both approaches produced similar results across independent cohorts.

---

## How Accurate Was the Prediction?

Across cohorts:

- Median absolute error: approximately **3–4 years**
- Good discrimination in ranking risk
- Consistent validation across two independent research groups

This level of precision is meaningful for **clinical trials**, where predicting group-level conversion windows is valuable.

It is not precise enough for personal forecasting.

---

## Why Age Changes the Timeline

One of the most important findings:

The time from biomarker positivity to symptom onset depends strongly on **age at positivity**.

In general:

- Individuals who became biomarker-positive around age 60 had a longer interval before symptoms.
- Those who became positive around age 80 developed symptoms sooner.

This suggests that:

- Brain resilience declines with age
- Co-existing pathologies may accelerate symptom expression
- Clinical onset reflects system vulnerability, not pathology alone

---

## Does This Support the Plaque Theory?

The study is consistent with modern amyloid and tau biomarker models of Alzheimer's disease:

- %p-tau217 correlates strongly with amyloid PET and tau PET.
- Positivity thresholds align with established amyloid benchmarks.

However, the findings also reinforce that:

> Symptoms emerge from the interaction between pathology and brain resilience.

Pathology is necessary — but not always sufficient — to determine timing of clinical decline.

---

## Could This Approach Apply to ALS?

Possibly — but with important differences.

Clock modeling works best when:

- A biomarker changes predictably over a long preclinical period.
- There is a definable biological transition event.
- Disease progression follows a relatively stable trajectory once initiated.

Alzheimer's disease fits these conditions.

ALS differs in that:

- Presymptomatic windows are shorter or less clearly defined.
- Progression is often more heterogeneous.
- Biomarkers such as neurofilament light reflect active neuronal injury rather than long buildup phases.

In ALS, models are more often used to estimate **rate of decline** rather than long-range onset timing.

## Would Knowing an Onset Profile Change Anything?

### Clinical Trials

Yes. This is the primary immediate application.

Clock models may help:

- Select individuals likely to convert within 3–5 years
- Reduce trial duration
- Increase statistical power

### Clinical Practice

Current expert guidance discourages biomarker testing in cognitively unimpaired individuals outside research settings.

Clock models are not yet suitable for individual life-planning decisions.

## FAQ

### Is this blood test available now?

Some plasma p-tau217 assays are clinically available in certain contexts. Clock-based symptom timing prediction remains a research application.

### Should I get tested if I have no symptoms?

Current expert guidance does not recommend biomarker testing for cognitively unimpaired individuals outside research studies.

### Does this mean doctors can predict exactly when dementia will start?

No. The typical prediction error is around 3–4 years, which is not precise enough for exact forecasting.
