# Infectious Diseases — Guide Hub

Infectious diseases are caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites.  
They range from short-term illnesses like influenza to life-threatening conditions such as tuberculosis or measles.  
Vaccination, hygiene, and early treatment remain the most effective ways to reduce their impact.  

This hub connects our guides on common infections and prevention strategies, including vaccine-preventable diseases.
