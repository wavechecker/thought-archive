## Intro
Prediabetes is a condition where blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed as type 2 diabetes. It’s a **warning sign** that the body is starting to lose its ability to regulate glucose effectively. The good news: lifestyle changes at this stage can **prevent or delay progression** to type 2 diabetes.

## Key Points
- Prediabetes affects hundreds of millions globally — many don’t know they have it.  
- Blood sugar levels are above normal but below the threshold for diabetes.  
- Strongly linked to overweight, obesity, and inactivity.  
- Often silent — symptoms are rare.  
- Early intervention can cut the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by **40–70%**.  

## Background
Glucose (blood sugar) fuels the body. In prediabetes, insulin becomes less effective at moving glucose into cells — known as **insulin resistance**. Over time, this can damage the pancreas and lead to type 2 diabetes. Prediabetes also increases risk for **heart disease and stroke**, even before diabetes develops.

## Causes or Mechanisms
- **Weight and obesity**: Excess body fat, especially around the waist.  
- **Diet**: High intake of sugary drinks, refined carbs, and processed foods.  
- **Physical inactivity**: Sedentary lifestyles increase insulin resistance.  
- **Genetics**: Family history of type 2 diabetes.  
- **Age and ethnicity**: Higher prevalence with age, and in certain groups (e.g., South Asian, Pacific Islander, Hispanic, African ancestry).  

## Symptoms
- Often **no symptoms**.  
- Sometimes subtle signs: fatigue, increased thirst, frequent urination.  
- Many are diagnosed only through blood tests.  

## Diagnosis / Screening
- **Fasting plasma glucose (FPG)**: 100–125 mg/dL (5.6–6.9 mmol/L).  
- **HbA1c**: 5.7–6.4%.  
- **Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)**: 2-hour plasma glucose 140–199 mg/dL (7.8–11.0 mmol/L).  
- Screening is recommended for overweight adults and at-risk children/adolescents.  

## Treatment / Options
- **Lifestyle first**:  
  - Weight reduction (5–10% of body weight).  
  - Healthy diet (whole grains, fruits, vegetables, lean proteins).  
  - 150+ minutes per week of moderate physical activity.  
- **Medical support**:  
  - Metformin may be considered in high-risk individuals (young, obese, strong family history).  
- **Monitoring**: Regular blood sugar checks to catch early progression.  

## Risks / Prognosis
- Up to **70% of people with prediabetes** eventually develop type 2 diabetes if untreated.  
- Early lifestyle changes can **reverse prediabetes** in many cases.  
- Even without diabetes, prediabetes increases the risk of heart disease, kidney problems, and nerve damage.  

## Action Plan: What You Can Do Today
**Small steps add up. Here are practical ways to take action against prediabetes — starting now:**

### Daily Habits
- 🚶 **Move more**: Aim for a 10–15 minute walk after meals. It helps lower blood sugar immediately.  
- 🥗 **Swap smart**: Replace one sugary drink or snack today with water, fruit, or nuts.  
- 🛏 **Prioritize sleep**: 7–9 hours of quality sleep supports insulin sensitivity.  

### Weekly Goals
- 📅 **Activity target**: Work toward 150 minutes of moderate activity per week (e.g., brisk walking, cycling, swimming).  
- 🍳 **Meal planning**: Cook at least 3 balanced meals at home instead of relying on fast food or takeout.  
- 📉 **Track progress**: Weigh yourself once per week — losing even 5% of body weight can cut diabetes risk significantly.  

### Bigger Actions
- 🧪 **Get tested**: If you’re at risk (overweight, family history, inactive), ask your doctor for a fasting glucose or HbA1c test.  
- 📏 **Check your waist–hip ratio**: This simple measure helps identify health risks earlier than weight or BMI alone. Use our [Waist–Hip Ratio resource](/resources/waist-hip-ratio) to calculate yours today.  
- 👨‍👩‍👧 **Family approach**: Make healthy eating and activity a household routine — kids learn by example.  
- 👩‍⚕️ **Follow up**: Schedule regular check-ins with your healthcare provider to track blood sugar and risk factors.

⚡ **Bottom line:** You don’t need to overhaul your life overnight. Small daily changes, consistently applied, can prevent or delay type 2 diabetes — and improve your overall health.

## FAQ
**Q: Can prediabetes be reversed?**  
A: Yes — with weight loss, healthy eating, and regular activity, many people return to normal glucose levels.  

**Q: Is medication always needed?**  
A: Not usually. Lifestyle changes are the cornerstone, though metformin may be prescribed for those at very high risk.  

**Q: Should children be screened?**  
A: Yes — especially if overweight or obese with additional risk factors (family history, inactivity, certain ethnic backgrounds).
