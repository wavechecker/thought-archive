## What this is (plain language)
High blood pressure means the force of blood against your artery walls is too high. Most people have no symptoms.

## Daily self-care (do this)
- Check your blood pressure at home as advised.
- Take medicines at the same time each day.
- Limit salt, alcohol, and ultra-processed foods.
- Move your body most days (aim for 150 minutes/week).
- Work toward healthy weight and good sleep.

## Don’t do this
- Don’t stop medicines without speaking to your clinician.
- Don’t double dose if you miss a dose (ask what to do).
- Don’t ignore very high readings or red-flag symptoms.

## Red-flag symptoms (get urgent care)
- Chest pain/pressure, shortness of breath, fainting.
- Severe headache, confusion, vision changes, weakness on one side.
- Readings above the emergency threshold your clinician gave you.

## Common medicines (know the basics)
ACE inhibitors (e.g., enalapril), ARBs (e.g., losartan), calcium channel blockers (e.g., amlodipine), diuretics. Report cough, swelling, dizziness.
