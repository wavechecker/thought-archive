## Intro
Drug health and safety means understanding how substances — prescribed or otherwise — affect the body, how they interact, and how to reduce harm while using them.

## Key Points
- Mixing substances (like **fentanyl + alcohol**) greatly increases overdose risk.  
- **Polypharmacy** (multiple prescriptions) is common in older adults and requires regular review.  
- Harm-reduction measures — such as using **naloxone**, avoiding using alone, and testing drugs — save lives.  
- Recognizing early signs of toxicity can prevent fatal outcomes.  

## Background
Even legitimate medications can be risky when combined or misused. Opioids, benzodiazepines, alcohol, and stimulants can all depress or overstimulate the nervous system. Fentanyl’s potency (50–100× morphine) makes it especially dangerous when misused or unknowingly consumed in counterfeit pills.

## Causes or Mechanisms
Fentanyl depresses the respiratory center in the brain. When combined with alcohol, sedatives, or other opioids, breathing slows further — leading to hypoxia, brain injury, or death.  
Other interactions (e.g., stimulants + opioids) strain the heart and cause unpredictable physiological effects.

## Prevention & Safe Use
- **Review medications** regularly with a healthcare provider.  
- **Avoid combining** sedatives or alcohol with opioids.  
- **Use drug-checking kits** when possible to test for fentanyl.  
- **Carry naloxone** if opioids are used or present in the household.  
- **Never use alone** — have someone who can respond in an emergency.  

## Risks & Prognosis
Overdose risk increases sharply when:
- Fentanyl is taken unknowingly in counterfeit pills or mixed substances.  
- Alcohol, benzodiazepines, or sleep aids are used concurrently.  
- Respiratory conditions, older age, or poor health are factors.

## FAQ
**Q: How common is fentanyl contamination?**  
A: Widely documented in counterfeit pills, heroin, and even cocaine.  

**Q: Can prescription fentanyl be safe?**  
A: Yes, when used exactly as prescribed under close medical supervision. The risk rises sharply with misuse.  

**Q: Is naloxone safe for everyone?**  
A: Yes — it has no effect on non-opioid overdoses and is safe to administer if an opioid overdose is suspected.
