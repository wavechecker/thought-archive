# Bowel Cancer Screening — Colonoscopy, FIT Test, and Early Detection

Screening can find bowel cancer before symptoms develop.

## Key points
- **FIT test:** stool sample checks for hidden blood.  
- **Colonoscopy:** gold standard — direct look at bowel, can remove polyps.  
- **Eligibility:** usually starts age 50 (earlier if family risk).
