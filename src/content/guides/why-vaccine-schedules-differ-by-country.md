## Intro

Many countries with excellent child health outcomes use **different vaccination schedules**. This often leads to confusion and claims that one country is “doing it better.”

In reality, schedules reflect **local optimization**, not ideology.

## Key Points

- There is no single global “best” schedule
- Differences reflect disease burden and system reliability
- More vaccines does not equal more immune stress
- Delays increase vulnerability during infancy

## What Shapes a National Schedule?

### Disease Epidemiology
If a disease is rare or concentrated in specific groups, a country may choose targeted vaccination.

### Health-System Reliability
Centralized systems can rely on follow-up. Fragmented systems often cannot.

### Equity Considerations
Universal schedules protect children most likely to miss care.

### Cost-Effectiveness
Public programs must weigh benefit per dollar spent.

## Why Schedules Change Over Time

Schedules evolve when:
- Disease patterns change
- New vaccines become available
- Delivery systems improve
- Better data emerges

Change is expected — but it should be **gradual, transparent, and evidence-led**.

## Common Myths

**Myth: Fewer vaccines are safer**  
Reality: Modern schedules expose children to fewer antigens than decades ago.

**Myth: Delaying vaccines is more “natural”**  
Reality: Delay increases the period of risk for severe disease.

## Bottom Line

Different schedules do not mean different commitments to science.

They reflect different systems solving the same problem:  
**how to protect children as effectively and equitably as possible.**
