## Intro
Mental health crises can be just as urgent as physical emergencies.  
A crisis may involve suicidal thoughts, self-harm, severe panic, or psychosis. Quick recognition and calm support can keep the person safe until professional help arrives.

## Key Points
- **Take all suicidal thoughts seriously** — ask directly if they are thinking of suicide.  
- **Stay with the person** — do not leave them alone if they are at risk of harm.  
- **Call emergency services** if there is immediate danger.  
- Provide **calm reassurance** and remove means of self-harm if safe to do so.  
- Encourage connection with professional or crisis services.  

## Warning Signs of Crisis
- Talking about wanting to die or self-harm.  
- Expressing hopelessness or feeling like a burden.  
- Severe panic or anxiety attacks that do not settle.  
- Extreme withdrawal, confusion, or disorganized thinking.  
- Hallucinations or delusions (psychosis).  

## First Aid Actions
1. **Stay calm** and ensure safety for both of you.  
2. **Ask directly**: “Are you thinking about suicide?”  
   - Asking does not increase risk — it shows you care.  
3. **Listen without judgment** — avoid arguing, minimising, or offering quick fixes.  
4. **Remove means of harm** (medications, weapons) if it can be done safely.  
5. **Call emergency services** (000/911/112) if the person has a plan or is at immediate risk.  
6. **If not urgent**: encourage contacting a GP, psychologist, or crisis line.  

## After the Crisis
- Encourage follow-up with a doctor or mental health professional.  
- Offer ongoing support — check in regularly.  
- Respect confidentiality, but do not keep suicidal thoughts a secret if safety is at risk.  

## FAQ
**Q: What if I say the wrong thing?**  
A: Being present and compassionate matters more than perfect words.  

**Q: Should I leave if they tell me to go?**  
A: If you believe they are unsafe, stay nearby and call for professional help.  

**Q: Can panic attacks be life-threatening?**  
A: Panic itself is not usually dangerous, but it can feel terrifying and may mask other emergencies. If unsure, seek urgent medical review.
