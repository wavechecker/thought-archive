## Intro
With stroke, **time = brain**. Every minute without treatment leads to more brain cells lost. Quick recognition and action greatly improve survival and recovery.

## Key Points
- Stroke occurs when blood flow to the brain is blocked (ischemic) or a vessel bursts (hemorrhagic).  
- The **FAST test** is the simplest way to recognize stroke symptoms.  
- Call emergency services immediately — **do not wait**.  
- Early treatment with clot-busting drugs or thrombectomy can prevent long-term disability.  
- A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a “mini-stroke” and a red flag for a major stroke soon after.  

## FAST Test
- **F — Face:** drooping or uneven smile  
- **A — Arm:** weakness, one arm drifts down  
- **S — Speech:** slurred, strange, or hard to understand  
- **T — Time:** call emergency services immediately  

## Other Warning Signs
- Sudden **vision loss** or double vision  
- Sudden **severe headache**, especially with neck stiffness  
- Sudden **confusion**, dizziness, or balance problems  
- Sudden **numbness or weakness** on one side of the body  

## What to Do
- Call emergency services — **do not drive yourself**.  
- Note the **time symptoms started** (crucial for treatment decisions).  
- Do not give aspirin unless instructed (dangerous if hemorrhagic stroke).  
- Stay with the person, keep them safe, and ensure the airway is clear.  

## After a TIA (“Mini-Stroke”)
- Symptoms may resolve in minutes, but the risk of a major stroke is high.  
- Urgent medical evaluation is required, even if the person feels better.  

## FAQ
**Q: Can strokes happen in younger people?**  
A: Yes. While more common with age, strokes can occur at any age, especially with risk factors (high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking).  

**Q: How fast should I act?**  
A: Immediately — stroke treatments are most effective within the first **3–4.5 hours** of symptom onset.  

**Q: Is a severe headache always a stroke?**  
A: No, but a sudden “worst-ever” headache can be a sign of hemorrhagic stroke. Always treat as urgent.
