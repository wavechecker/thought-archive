# COVID-19 Vaccines

## Intro
COVID-19 vaccines are the first line of defense against severe illness and death from SARS-CoV-2. Multiple platforms — mRNA, viral vector, and protein subunit vaccines — have been deployed worldwide.  
This guide provides an overview of how these vaccines work, what the evidence shows about benefits and risks, and why vaccination remains an important public health tool.

## Key Points
- **Effectiveness:** All major vaccines significantly reduce the risk of severe disease, hospitalization, and death.  
- **Waning immunity:** Protection against infection decreases over time; boosters restore protection, especially against new variants.  
- **Safety:** Monitoring systems continue to show that serious adverse events are rare and outweighed by the benefits.  
- **Equity:** Global rollout exposed stark inequalities in vaccine access and uptake.  

## Background
- **Timeline:**  
  - Late 2020: first mRNA vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna) authorized.  
  - 2021: viral vector vaccines (AstraZeneca, J&J), protein subunit (Novavax) added.  
  - 2022–25: adapted boosters rolled out to target Omicron and later variants.  

- **Global rollout:**  
  Over 13 billion doses have been administered globally. High-income countries achieved >70% coverage, while low-income regions lagged, highlighting challenges of supply, logistics, and vaccine confidence.

- **Variants:**  
  Alpha, Delta, and Omicron waves demonstrated both the resilience and the limits of vaccines, driving updates to formulations and booster recommendations.

## Evidence
- **Clinical trials:** Phase III studies demonstrated ~90–95% efficacy against symptomatic infection (mRNA) and strong protection from severe outcomes across platforms.  
- **Real-world studies:** Consistently show high effectiveness against hospitalization and death, even as variant-driven breakthrough infections occur.  
- **Meta-analyses:** Confirm sustained benefit of vaccination, particularly in reducing mortality and long-COVID risk.  

## Risks and Benefits
- **Benefits:** Significant reduction in severe disease and transmission; supports healthcare system stability; reduces long-term complications.  
- **Risks:**  
  - *Myocarditis and pericarditis* — rare, mostly in younger males after mRNA vaccines; generally mild and self-limited.  
  - *Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS)* — rare, linked to adenoviral vector vaccines; risk now managed with age- or sex-specific recommendations.  
  - *Other adverse events:* Ongoing safety surveillance shows very low incidence compared to risks from COVID itself.  

## FAQ
**Q: Do boosters still help?**  
A: Yes. Boosters restore waning immunity, especially against hospitalization and severe disease from Omicron-family variants. Updated formulations improve protection against currently circulating strains.

**Q: Can I still get infected after vaccination?**  
A: Yes, but breakthrough infections are usually milder. The main value of vaccination is reducing severe outcomes.

**Q: Are vaccines safe for children and pregnant women?**  
A: Major health agencies (CDC, EMA, WHO) recommend vaccination in these groups. Data shows safety and benefit outweigh risks.

**Q: What about long-term effects?**  
A: To date, no unexpected long-term harms have been identified. Ongoing safety monitoring has not detected late-emerging risks.
