faq:
  - q: What causes cellulitis?
    a: >-
      Usually group A streptococci or Staphylococcus aureus, entering through a
      break in the skin.
  - q: When should I seek urgent care?
    a: >-
      If you have fever, rapidly spreading redness, severe pain, blisters/skin
      breakdown, or confusion — call emergency services.
  - q: Can cellulitis come back?
    a: >-
      Yes — recurrence is common in people with chronic swelling or skin barrier
      problems. Preventive measures may be needed.
  - q: Is cellulitis contagious?
    a: >-
      No — you can’t catch cellulitis from someone else, though the bacteria
      that cause it can be spread.

## Intro
Cellulitis is a **bacterial infection of the skin** and soft tissues. It is common, but if untreated can spread quickly and become life-threatening.

## Key Points
- Classic signs: **redness, swelling, warmth, pain**, sometimes fever.  
- Usually caused by **streptococci or staphylococci**.  
- **Rapid progression or systemic illness** needs urgent care.  
- Treatment: **antibiotics**; sometimes drainage of abscesses.  
- Recurrence is common in chronic swelling or skin barrier disease.

## Background
Skin provides a barrier against infection. When bacteria enter through breaks, cellulitis develops in the dermis and subcutaneous tissues.

## Causes or Mechanisms
Group A *Streptococcus* (Strep pyogenes) and *Staphylococcus aureus* are most common. MRSA is a concern in some settings.

## Diagnosis / Treatment / Options
**Diagnosis:** clinical (red, hot, swollen area); labs/imaging in severe/atypical cases.  
**Treatment:** oral or IV antibiotics depending on severity; pain control; elevate limb; drain abscesses if present.  

## Risks / Benefits / Prognosis
Most people recover with antibiotics. Severe or untreated cellulitis can lead to sepsis, necrotizing infection, or chronic recurrence.

## FAQ
**Q: Can I prevent cellulitis?**  
A: Yes — treat athlete’s foot, moisturize skin, avoid trauma, and manage swelling/lymphedema.
