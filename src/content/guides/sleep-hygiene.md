## Intro
Sleep hygiene refers to the set of everyday habits and environmental factors that influence sleep quality. Good sleep hygiene strengthens the body’s natural sleep–wake rhythm, while poor habits — late-night screens, caffeine, inconsistent schedules — can make sleep harder to come by.

## Key Points
- **Sleep hygiene is about daily habits and environment.**  
- Consistency is key: same bedtime and wake time, even on weekends.  
- Morning daylight exposure and evening light reduction are critical.  
- Caffeine, alcohol, and screens all affect sleep.  
- Good sleep hygiene helps most people, but chronic insomnia often requires CBT-I.  

## Background
The term “sleep hygiene” has been used since the 1970s to describe behavioral and environmental recommendations for better sleep. While often overlooked, these habits form the foundation of healthy sleep and are often included as a first step in managing insomnia.

## Core Habits
- **Consistency:** Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day.  
- **Morning light:** Exposure to natural light soon after waking reinforces circadian rhythms.  
- **Limit stimulants:** Avoid caffeine, nicotine, and heavy meals in the evening.  
- **Wind-down routine:** Reading, stretching, or calming activities prepare the body for rest.  
- **Screen curfew:** Blue light from phones and computers delays melatonin release.  
- **Optimize environment:** A cool, dark, quiet bedroom improves sleep efficiency.  
- **Bed = sleep and sex:** Avoid working, scrolling, or eating in bed.  

## Risks / Benefits / Prognosis
- **Benefits:** Better sleep onset, deeper sleep, improved mood and energy.  
- **Risks:** Few risks; some people find it hard to stick to routines.  
- **Prognosis:** Most people improve with consistent habits, though chronic insomnia typically requires CBT-I.
