      question: "Is lifespan mostly genetic?",
      answer:
        "No. Genetics contributes, but environment, disease exposure, and socioeconomic factors strongly influence lifespan at the population level.",

      question: "Why did lifespan rise so much in the last century?",
      answer:
        "Large gains came from reducing extrinsic mortality: sanitation, vaccines, antibiotics, safer food and water, and improved emergency and cardiovascular care.",

      question: "What is the biggest limiter of lifespan today?",
      answer:
        "Chronic disease risk (especially cardiometabolic disease) and age-related vulnerability. The balance varies by country and context.",

## Intro

Human lifespan is shaped by two broad forces:

- **Intrinsic biology** (the aging process and inherited risk)
- **Extrinsic risk** (infection, trauma, environment, and social conditions)

Understanding lifespan means understanding how these forces interact across a lifetime.

## Key Points

- Lifespan is not “genes vs lifestyle” — it’s biology *plus* exposure and risk.
- Public health primarily extends lifespan by reducing extrinsic mortality.
- As extrinsic mortality falls, intrinsic aging becomes more visible.
- Healthspan is often the more actionable target. (See: [/guides/healthspan-vs-lifespan])

## The Big Determinants

### 1) Early-life conditions
Nutrition, infection burden, stress, and access to care in childhood can influence lifelong risk.

### 2) Cardiometabolic risk
Blood pressure, glucose, smoking, obesity, and lipids strongly influence survival.

### 3) Socioeconomic conditions
Income, education, housing, and access to care shape exposure to risk and chronic disease management.

### 4) Genetics
Genetics can influence risk pathways (lipids, inflammation, dementia risk, etc.). Effects often become more noticeable at older ages.

### 5) Intrinsic vs extrinsic mortality
See: [/guides/intrinsic-vs-extrinsic-mortality]

## FAQ

**Q: If lifespan is partly genetic, can you “outrun” your genes?**  
A: Often you can reduce risk substantially by changing exposures and managing modifiable risk factors.
