## Intro
Anaphylaxis is a **life-threatening allergic reaction** that develops quickly. Early recognition and **immediate epinephrine (adrenaline)** can save a life. Always seek emergency care after treatment because symptoms can return.

## Key Points
- **Give epinephrine first, fast.** Don’t wait to see if it improves.
- **Call emergency services immediately** after the first dose.
- **Lay the person flat** with legs raised; **pregnant → left side**; **breathing trouble → sit up slightly**.
- If no improvement in **5–10 minutes**, give a **second auto-injector** (if available).

## Recognize Anaphylaxis (any one of these after exposure to a likely allergen)
- **Breathing problems:** noisy breathing, wheeze, throat tightness, hoarse voice.
- **Circulation problems:** pale/clammy, faintness, weak pulse, collapse.
- **Skin/gut symptoms plus breathing/circulation signs:** widespread hives/flush, swelling of lips/tongue/face, severe tummy cramps/vomiting.
- **Rapid onset** minutes to (less commonly) hours after food, stings, meds, latex, etc.

## What To Do — Step by Step
1. **Use an epinephrine auto-injector now.**  
   - Inject into the **outer mid-thigh** through clothing if needed.  
   - Hold in place per device instructions (usually ~3 seconds).
2. **Call emergency services** immediately (even if symptoms improve).
3. **Position**  
   - **Lay flat, legs raised**.  
   - **Breathing trouble:** semi-reclined (avoid standing/walking).  
   - **Pregnant:** left side.
4. **Second dose** if not improving in **5–10 minutes** (use a second auto-injector).
5. **Monitor airway & breathing.** Be ready to start CPR if needed.
6. **Avoid** giving food/drink. **Do not** rely on antihistamines or inhalers instead of epinephrine.

## Aftercare & Observation
- Must be observed in hospital; **biphasic reactions** can occur hours later.
- Record **time(s) of injection** and device type for clinicians.
- If stung, scrape off the stinger; apply cold pack for pain/swelling.

## Auto-Injector Tips
- Common brands: EpiPen, Jext, Auvi-Q (device instructions vary—practice with a trainer).
- **Dosage (typical):**  
  - Children 7.5–25 kg: **0.15 mg**  
  - ≥25–30 kg and adults: **0.3 mg** (some adults may be prescribed **0.5 mg**)  
  *Follow the device prescribed by a clinician.*
- Check **expiry dates** and store at room temperature (avoid heat/light).

## Prevention & Planning
- Identify triggers (foods, stinging insects, meds, latex).  
- Carry **two** auto-injectors at all times if prescribed.  
- Wear medical ID; share an **action plan** with family, school, or workplace.
- Ask about **allergen immunotherapy** (e.g., venom) if appropriate.

## FAQ
**Can antihistamines replace epinephrine?**  
No. They may help itch/hives but **do not** treat airway or circulation problems.

**What if I’m not sure it’s anaphylaxis?**  
If in doubt, **use epinephrine**. The risk of giving it unnecessarily is low; delay is dangerous.

**Asthma + food allergy — higher risk?**  
Yes. Poorly controlled asthma increases risk for severe reactions; ensure asthma is well managed.
