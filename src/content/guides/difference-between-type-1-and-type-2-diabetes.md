While both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes involve high blood sugar levels, the causes, onset, and management differ.

### Type 1 Diabetes
- **Cause:** The immune system attacks insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.  
- **Onset:** Often in childhood or adolescence, but can develop at any age.  
- **Treatment:** Lifelong insulin therapy, careful blood glucose monitoring.  
- **Prevention:** Currently none — focus is on management.  

### Type 2 Diabetes
- **Cause:** The body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn't make enough.  
- **Onset:** Usually in adults over 40, but increasingly seen in younger people — including children.  
- **Treatment:** Lifestyle changes, oral medicines, sometimes insulin.  
- **Prevention:** Healthy diet, regular exercise, maintaining a healthy weight.  

**Key difference:** Type 1 is an autoimmune condition requiring insulin from diagnosis; Type 2 often develops gradually and can sometimes be managed without insulin early on.

## FAQs

**Q: Can Type 2 diabetes turn into Type 1?**  
A: No — they are different conditions. Type 1 is an autoimmune disease where the body stops producing insulin. Type 2 is linked to insulin resistance and lifestyle factors. However, some people with long-standing Type 2 may eventually need insulin treatment.

**Q: Which type needs insulin from the start?**  
A: People with Type 1 always need insulin from diagnosis. People with Type 2 may manage with lifestyle changes and tablets initially, but some will later require insulin.

**Q: Can children develop Type 2 diabetes?**  
A: Yes — while Type 1 is more common in children, rising obesity and inactivity have led to more cases of Type 2 in younger people. See our [guide on diabetes in children and adolescents](/guides/diabetes-children-adolescents).  

**Q: Is one type more serious than the other?**  
A: Both can be serious if not managed. Type 1 carries immediate risks if insulin is missed, while Type 2 raises long-term risks for heart, kidney, and eye disease. Good management reduces complications in both types.

⚠️ **Both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes require medical care.**  
If you have symptoms such as frequent urination, extreme thirst, unexplained weight loss, or fatigue, **see a doctor promptly for testing and treatment**.  

If you're unsure which type you have, see your healthcare provider — accurate diagnosis guides effective treatment.
