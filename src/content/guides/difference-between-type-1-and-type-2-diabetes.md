While both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes involve high blood sugar levels, the causes, onset, and management differ.

### Type 1 Diabetes
- **Cause:** The immune system attacks insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.  
- **Onset:** Often in childhood or adolescence, but can develop at any age.  
- **Treatment:** Lifelong insulin therapy, careful blood glucose monitoring.  
- **Prevention:** Currently none — focus is on management.  

### Type 2 Diabetes
- **Cause:** The body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn’t make enough.  
- **Onset:** Usually in adults over 40, but increasingly seen in younger people.  
- **Treatment:** Lifestyle changes, oral medicines, sometimes insulin.  
- **Prevention:** Healthy diet, regular exercise, maintaining a healthy weight.  

**Key difference:** Type 1 is an autoimmune condition requiring insulin from diagnosis; Type 2 often develops gradually and can sometimes be managed without insulin early on.  

If you’re unsure which type you have, see your healthcare provider — accurate diagnosis guides effective treatment.
