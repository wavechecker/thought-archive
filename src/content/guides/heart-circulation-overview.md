## Intro
The cardiovascular system supplies oxygen and nutrients throughout the body. Heart and circulation health is critical for longevity, quality of life, and prevention of disease.

## Key Points
- Major cardiovascular risks: high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, smoking, family history.  
- Conditions include coronary artery disease, stroke, heart failure, arrhythmias.  
- Prevention through diet, exercise, and blood pressure/cholesterol control is key.  

## Background
Cardiovascular disease remains the leading global cause of death. Many risk factors are modifiable through lifestyle and medical therapy.

## Causes or Mechanisms
- **Atherosclerosis**: buildup of plaque in arteries.  
- **Hypertension**: damages vessels and heart muscle.  
- **Arrhythmias**: irregular heart rhythms affecting circulation.  

## Diagnosis / Treatment / Options
- **Diagnosis**: blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose, ECG, echocardiography, stress testing.  
- **Treatment**: lifestyle changes, medications (antihypertensives, statins, antiplatelets), surgery (stents, bypass).  

## Risks / Prognosis
- Early detection and treatment dramatically reduce risk.  
- Prognosis depends on severity, treatment adherence, and lifestyle modification.  

## FAQ
**Q: Whatâ€™s the single most important risk factor?**  
A: High blood pressure is the most common and preventable cause of cardiovascular disease.  

**Q: Can exercise reverse heart disease?**  
A: Regular activity improves blood pressure, cholesterol, and heart efficiency, reducing disease burden.  

**Q: How often should I be checked?**  
A: Adults should check blood pressure at least annually; cholesterol and glucose every few years or as advised.
