# Voluntary Assisted Dying (VAD) — Global Overview

## Intro
Voluntary Assisted Dying (VAD), also called medical assistance in dying (MAiD) or euthanasia, refers to the practice of a terminally ill person choosing to end their life with medical assistance under a regulated framework. It is a controversial but increasingly common option in end-of-life care.

---

## Key Points
- VAD is legal in **Australia, Canada, New Zealand, several European countries, and select US states**.  
- Safeguards usually require **multiple medical assessments**, **waiting periods**, and **independent review boards**.  
- Debates focus on **autonomy vs. protection**, **slippery slope concerns**, and the **role of doctors**.  
- Laws vary widely — some limited to terminal illness, others include chronic suffering or psychiatric conditions.

## Where It’s Legal

### Australia
- All states have now passed VAD laws (NSW last, 2023–24). Territories are reviewing.  
- Eligibility: incurable illness, expected death within 6–12 months, capacity to decide.  

### United Kingdom
- VAD remains **illegal** under the Suicide Act 1961.  
- Debate ongoing in Westminster; Crown dependencies (Jersey, Isle of Man) are considering reform.  

### Europe
- **Netherlands**: Euthanasia Act since 2002; includes unbearable suffering, not limited to terminal illness.  
- **Belgium**: Similar to Netherlands; includes psychiatric illness and minors under strict rules.  
- **Luxembourg, Spain, Portugal**: Recently legalized with safeguards.  
- **Switzerland**: Assisted suicide permitted since 1940s, widely used.  
- **Austria**: Legal since 2022.  
- **France**: Debating.  

### North America
- **Canada**: MAiD since 2016, expanded 2021. Very broad scope (not only terminal).  
- **United States**: 11 states + DC allow physician-assisted dying (Oregon first, 1997).  

### Latin America
- **Colombia**: Constitutional court recognized right to euthanasia (1997), regulated since 2015.  
- **Chile, Uruguay**: Bills under debate.  

### Asia & Oceania
- **New Zealand**: Legal since 2021 (End of Life Choice Act).  
- **Asia**: Generally prohibited; strong cultural and religious opposition.  

---

## Ethical & Practical Debates
- **Safeguards vs. autonomy**: Protecting vulnerable people from pressure vs. respecting choice.  
- **Expansion risks**: Canada shows scope can grow beyond terminal illness.  
- **Medical ethics**: Some doctors refuse participation; conscience clauses are common.  
- **Social trust**: Families, prisons, and disability advocates raise unique concerns.  

---

## Patient Considerations
- **Eligibility**: Usually requires terminal illness, decision-making capacity, informed consent.  
- **Process**: Application → multiple assessments → waiting period → final consent.  
- **Alternatives**: Palliative care, hospice, pain management.  
- **Withdrawal**: Consent can be withdrawn at any time.
