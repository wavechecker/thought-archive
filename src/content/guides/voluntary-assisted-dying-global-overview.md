# Voluntary Assisted Dying (VAD) — Global Overview

## Intro
Voluntary Assisted Dying (VAD), also called medical assistance in dying (MAiD) or euthanasia, refers to the practice of a terminally ill person choosing to end their life with medical assistance under a regulated framework. It is a controversial but increasingly common option in end-of-life care.

## Key Points
- VAD is legal in **Australia, Canada, New Zealand, several European countries, and select US states**.  
- Safeguards usually require **multiple medical assessments**, **waiting periods**, and **independent review boards**.  
- Debates focus on **autonomy vs. protection**, **slippery slope concerns**, and the **role of doctors**.  
- Laws vary widely — some limited to terminal illness, others include chronic suffering or psychiatric conditions.

## Where It’s Legal

- **Austria**: Legal since 2022.  
- **France**: Debating.  

### North America

## Ethical & Practical Debates
- **Safeguards vs. autonomy**: Protecting vulnerable people from pressure vs. respecting choice.  
- **Expansion risks**: Canada shows scope can grow beyond terminal illness.  
- **Medical ethics**: Some doctors refuse participation; conscience clauses are common.  
- **Social trust**: Families, prisons, and disability advocates raise unique concerns.

## Patient Considerations
- **Eligibility**: Usually requires terminal illness, decision-making capacity, informed consent.  
- **Process**: Application → multiple assessments → waiting period → final consent.  
- **Alternatives**: Palliative care, hospice, pain management.  
- **Withdrawal**: Consent can be withdrawn at any time.
