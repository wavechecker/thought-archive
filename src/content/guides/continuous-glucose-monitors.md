# Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs) vs Finger‑Prick Testing

## What CGMs do well
- Trend arrows, alerts, and overnight data.
- Reduce finger‑pricks and help spot patterns.

## Known limits
- **Lag time**: interstitial glucose can trail blood glucose.
- Compression lows; sensor warm‑up periods; occasional sensor error.

## When to confirm with a finger‑prick
- Symptoms don't match CGM.
- Before driving if uncertain.
- During rapid changes (exercise, after treating a hypo).
- When calibrations/confirmations are recommended by your team.

## Practical tips
- Set **high/low alerts** thoughtfully to avoid alarm fatigue.
- Rotate sites; follow clean insertion technique.
- Have a **backup meter** and strips available.
