## The Long Timeline

Cervical cancer usually develops slowly, over **10–15 years**.

---

### Step 1: HPV Exposure
HPV infection is common and often clears naturally.

### Step 2: Persistent Infection
In some cases, the virus remains for years.

### Step 3: Precancerous Changes
Abnormal cells form — still reversible.

### Step 4: Localised Cancer
Cancer develops within the cervix.

### Step 5: Invasive Disease
Cancer spreads beyond the cervix if untreated.

## Where Screening Works

Screening interrupts this process at **Steps 2–3**, long before cancer forms.
