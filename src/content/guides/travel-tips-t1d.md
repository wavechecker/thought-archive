With the right preparation, travel is completely possible with Type 1 diabetes. Planning ahead avoids emergencies and keeps your trip on track.

**Before You Go:**
- Pack twice as much insulin and supplies as you think you'll need
- Carry a letter from your doctor for airport security
- Research local pharmacies and medical care options

**On the Move:**
- Keep insulin in your hand luggage, not checked baggage
- Adjust for time zone changes with your care team's advice

**Emergencies:**
- Always have quick-acting carbs on hand
- Wear medical ID
