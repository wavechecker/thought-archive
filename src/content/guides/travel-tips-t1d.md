## Intro
Travel with T1D is absolutely doable with good prep. The key is **redundancy** (spares of everything), **temperature control** for insulin, and a plan for **time zones and sick days**.

## Key Points
- Pack **double** the supplies you think you’ll need, split between **carry-on bags**.
- Keep insulin **cool but not frozen**; never check it into the hold.
- Adjust **basal/bolus** for long flights and **time-zone shifts**.
- Carry a **letter** for airport security plus **travel insurance** that covers diabetes.

## Pre-Trip Checklist
- **Prescriptions & letters:** clinician letter listing diagnosis, devices (pump/CGM), and medications.  
- **Insurance:** confirm it covers diabetes emergencies and supplies abroad.  
- **Vaccines & destination risks:** check any needed vaccines and access to care.  
- **Emergency contacts:** local clinic/hospital info; save numbers in your phone.

## Packing — The “Two of Everything” Rule
- **Insulin:** at least **2×** expected amount; split across bags.  
- **Delivery:** spare **pump** (if available) or **MDI backup** (pens/syringes + pen needles).  
- **Meters/CGM:** extra sensors, transmitter (if applicable), test strips, lancets, alcohol swabs.  
- **Power:** chargers, **spare batteries**, power bank, travel adapters.  
- **Hypo treatment:** glucose tabs/gel, small juices; keep within reach at all times.  
- **Sick-day kit:** ketone strips (blood/urine), thermometer, antiemetic (if prescribed).  
- **Cooling:** Frio pouch or small cooler packs for insulin (avoid direct ice).

## Airport Security & In-Flight
- Keep **all diabetes supplies in carry-on** with your letter.  
- **Pumps/CGMs:** many manufacturers advise **hand inspection** instead of X-ray/body scanners; check your device guidance.  
- Tell cabin crew you have T1D; bring snacks in case of delays.  
- Avoid dosing rapid insulin right before takeoff/landing if you might be interrupted—plan timing.

## Time Zones & Long Flights
- For **basal insulin (MDI)** across time zones:  
  - If traveling **east (shorter day):** take the next basal dose a bit **earlier**, splitting the difference if needed.  
  - **West (longer day):** take the next dose a bit **later**; small temporary top-ups may be required if running high.  
- **Pumps:** set local time on landing; consider **temp basal** adjustments during travel day.  
- **Bolus timing:** match to **local meals** as soon as practical.

> Individual plans vary—use the approach your clinician has given you.

## Heat, Cold, and Altitude
- **Heat:** insulin degrades >30°C (86°F). Use a cooling pouch; don’t leave in cars/sun.  
- **Cold:** don’t freeze insulin; keep close to body in very cold climates.  
- **Altitude:** sensor/pump adhesives may loosen—carry overpatches; pressure changes can cause small bubbles in tubing (prime/check sites).

## Illness & Sick-Day Rules
- Check **glucose and ketones more often** if unwell.  
- Keep **hydrated** (electrolytes if vomiting/diarrhea).  
- Follow your **correction plan**; seek medical care if ketones persist or you can’t keep fluids down.

## Eating Different Foods
- Estimate carbs conservatively for unfamiliar cuisines; prefer **finger-stick confirmation** if CGM readings seem off.  
- Alcohol can cause **delayed hypos**—eat with drinks and check before bed.

## When to Seek Urgent Care Abroad
- Vomiting with persistent **positive ketones**.  
- Signs of **DKA** (abdominal pain, deep breathing, confusion).  
- Repeated severe hypos needing assistance.

## FAQ
**Can I bring needles and glucagon on board?**  
Yes—with a clinician letter and meds in original packaging.

**What if my insulin overheats?**  
Discard if exposed to extreme heat; use backup supply kept in a cooling pouch.

**Do I need to change basal on the plane?**  
Often not for short flights. For long-haul/time-zone shifts, follow your personalized plan (temp basal on pumps, timing tweaks on MDI).
