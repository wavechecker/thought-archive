Understanding **target ranges** for blood glucose and ketones helps you know when things are on track â€” and when urgent action is needed.

## Blood Glucose (BGL) Targets

Typical goals for adults with Type 1 Diabetes (your individual plan may differ):

- **Before meals:** 4â€“7 mmol/L  
- **2 hours after meals:** < 10 mmol/L  
- **Bedtime:** 6â€“8 mmol/L  

### When to take action
- **< 4 mmol/L:** Hypoglycaemia â†’ treat with fast carbs (see [Hypo Treatment](/guides/hypoglycaemia-treatment)).  
- **> 14 mmol/L:** High risk zone â†’ check ketones, consider correction insulin.  
- **Persistent highs despite correction:** contact your diabetes team.

## Ketone Levels

Ketones indicate how much the body is breaking down fat for fuel. In Type 1 Diabetes, high ketones with high glucose can mean **diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)** risk.

- **< 0.6 mmol/L:** Normal (safe)  
- **0.6â€“1.4 mmol/L:** Mild elevation â€” recheck, hydrate, give correction insulin  
- **1.5â€“2.9 mmol/L:** Moderate â€” follow sick-day plan, increase monitoring  
- **â‰¥ 3.0 mmol/L:** High risk of DKA â€” seek urgent medical help

## Red Flags (Seek Help Immediately)
- Ketones â‰¥ 3.0 mmol/L  
- Vomiting or unable to keep fluids down  
- Abdominal pain, rapid breathing, drowsiness  
- Persistent BGL > 14 mmol/L despite correction insulin
