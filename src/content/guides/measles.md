## Overview
Measles is a highly contagious viral infection caused by the measles virus, a member of the paramyxovirus family. It spreads through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or even breathes. The virus can linger in the air or on surfaces for up to two hours.  

Before widespread vaccination, measles infected millions of children each year and caused hundreds of thousands of deaths globally. Thanks to immunization campaigns, measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000. However, declining vaccination rates have allowed outbreaks to re-emerge.

## Key Points
- Measles is **one of the most contagious diseases** known; a single case can infect 90% of nearby unvaccinated people.  
- About **95% vaccination coverage** is needed for herd immunity.  
- The **MMR vaccine** (measles, mumps, rubella) is safe and highly effective.  
- Outbreaks occur quickly when vaccination coverage falls below the herd immunity threshold.  
- Complications can include pneumonia, encephalitis (brain swelling), deafness, and death.  

## Symptoms
Measles symptoms typically appear 7–14 days after exposure:  
- High fever (often > 40°C / 104°F)  
- Cough, runny nose, red watery eyes  
- **Koplik spots**: tiny white spots inside the mouth, unique to measles  
- Rash: starts on the face/hairline and spreads downward to the trunk and limbs  

The illness lasts about 7–10 days. Patients are contagious from 4 days before the rash until 4 days after it appears.

## Complications
While measles is sometimes dismissed as a “childhood rash,” it can be deadly:  
- **Pneumonia**: most common cause of measles-related death in children.  
- **Encephalitis**: occurs in ~1 in 1,000 cases; can cause permanent brain damage.  
- **Death**: 1–2 per 1,000 cases in high-income countries; higher in low-resource settings.  
- **Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis (SSPE)**: a rare, fatal brain disorder developing years after infection.  

Infants, pregnant women, and immunocompromised individuals face the greatest risk.

## Prevention
- **MMR vaccine**:  
  - First dose at 12–15 months.  
  - Second dose at 4–6 years.  
  - Two doses provide ~97% protection; one dose provides ~93%.  
- **Catch-up vaccination**: older children and adults without documented immunity should receive the MMR vaccine.  
- **Herd immunity**: sustained coverage above 95% is critical to prevent outbreaks.  

## Recent Outbreaks
- In recent years, measles has resurged in parts of the U.S., Europe, and globally due to vaccine hesitancy and disruptions in healthcare access.  
- In 2025, Texas reported a large outbreak that spread to neighboring states, showing how quickly measles can return when vaccination coverage dips.  
- International travel plays a major role: imported cases spark outbreaks in undervaccinated communities.  

## FAQ
**Q: Is measles just a childhood illness?**  
A: No. It can cause severe disease and death in both children and adults.  

**Q: Can adults catch measles?**  
A: Yes. Adults without immunity (from vaccination or prior infection) remain at risk.  

**Q: Is the MMR vaccine safe?**  
A: Yes. Decades of research confirm its safety. Side effects are usually mild, such as fever or rash. Serious side effects are extremely rare.  

**Q: Why are measles outbreaks happening again?**  
A: Declines in vaccination coverage, fueled by misinformation and complacency, undermine herd immunity.
