# Evidence-First COVID Vaccine Policy

## Intro
COVID-19 vaccines remain one of the most debated public health interventions in modern history. This guide outlines how vaccine policy can be assessed on an **evidence-first basis**, balancing benefits and risks while ensuring patient choice and public trust.

## Key Points
- Evaluate effectiveness with **absolute measures**: Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR), Number Needed to Treat (NNT).  
- Present safety using **Number Needed to Harm (NNH)**, stratified by age, sex, and comorbidity.  
- Ensure **transparent communication**: what we know, what we donâ€™t, and when guidance will be reviewed.  
- Reserve **mandates or withdrawals** for extreme scenarios, with clear criteria and expiry dates.  
- Protect **patient autonomy** through accessible, plain-language decision tools.

## Background
COVID-19 vaccines were introduced under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in 2020 and scaled rapidly worldwide. Initial data showed large benefits in reducing severe disease and death, particularly among older and high-risk groups. Over time, issues emerged around waning protection, breakthrough infections, and rare but serious adverse events.  

Policy has often been shaped as much by politics and trust dynamics as by raw evidence. An evidence-first framework helps distinguish scientific findings from political narratives.

## Causes or Mechanisms
- **Effectiveness:** Measured by outcomes prevented (hospitalization, death), expressed as ARR and NNT.  
- **Safety:** Monitored through surveillance systems such as VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System) and VSD (Vaccine Safety Datalink). Risk is expressed as incidence rates and NNH.  
- **Uncertainty:** Variants, prior infection, and time since vaccination affect outcomes; policies must account for these moving parts.  

## Diagnosis / Treatment / Options
- **Risk-benefit analysis:**  
  - High-risk groups (older adults, comorbidities) generally see higher benefit.  
  - Younger, low-risk groups may face smaller benefit and relatively higher risk from rare adverse events.  
- **Policy levers:**  
  - **Recommendations**: age- and risk-specific, evidence-based.  
  - **Mandates**: reserved for high-risk settings (e.g., healthcare, elder care) during acute emergencies.  
  - **Market withdrawal**: only when benefits are outweighed by risks across all subgroups.  

## Risks / Benefits / Prognosis
- **Benefits:** Reduction in severe outcomes and deaths during peak pandemic waves.  
- **Risks:** Rare myocarditis, clotting events, and other adverse effects.  
- **Prognosis:** With widespread prior infection and partial immunity, the net benefit of continued vaccination varies by subgroup. Evidence-first policy requires continuous review.  

## FAQ
**Q: What do ARR, NNT, and NNH mean?**  
A:  
- ARR = Absolute Risk Reduction (the actual percentage reduction in bad outcomes).  
- NNT = Number Needed to Treat (how many people need vaccination to prevent one outcome).  
- NNH = Number Needed to Harm (how many people need vaccination for one additional adverse event to occur).  

**Q: Should young, healthy adults still get boosters?**  
A: Decisions should weigh their **baseline risk** of severe disease against the known incidence of adverse events, using ARR, NNT, and NNH.  

**Q: When should governments step in?**  
A: Only when public health or safety thresholds are crossed (e.g., hospital systems overwhelmed, clear safety signals confirmed), with transparent criteria and time limits.
