# Cardiac Rehabilitation After a Heart Event

Cardiac rehabilitation (rehab) is a structured program of exercise, education, and support after a heart attack, surgery, or diagnosis of heart disease. It helps you recover safely and reduce the risk of future problems.

## Why Cardiac Rehab Matters
- Builds strength and stamina after a heart event  
- Teaches safe ways to be active again  
- Supports emotional recovery (many people feel anxious or low)  
- Provides education about medicines, diet, and risk factors  
- Connects you with a healthcare team that monitors your progress  

## Phases of Rehab

### In-Hospital Phase
- Begins soon after your event or surgery  
- Gentle movement: sitting up, walking short distances  
- Monitoring recovery and preventing complications  

### Supervised Outpatient Phase
- Usually lasts several weeks to months  
- Structured exercise sessions with heart monitoring  
- Education on nutrition, stress, smoking cessation, and medication use  
- Tailored to your personal health goals and medical history  

### Ongoing Maintenance
- Independent exercise (walking, cycling, swimming, gym)  
- Long-term healthy habits: balanced diet, weight management, regular check-ups  
- Staying connected to support networks if needed  

## Common Activities in Rehab
- **Aerobic exercise:** walking on a treadmill, cycling, light jogging  
- **Strength training:** resistance bands or light weights  
- **Flexibility and balance:** stretching, yoga, breathing exercises  
- **Education sessions:** cholesterol, blood pressure, and stress management  

## Benefits Backed by Evidence
- Improved fitness and heart function  
- Lower risk of future heart attack or hospitalization  
- Better control of blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes  
- Increased confidence in returning to normal activities  
- Enhanced mood and reduced anxiety or depression
