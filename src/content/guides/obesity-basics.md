## Intro
Obesity is a chronic condition where excess body fat increases the risk of disease. It’s commonly assessed using Body Mass Index (BMI), waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio. Beyond weight, obesity influences metabolism, inflammation, and cardiovascular risk.

## Key Points
- Defined by excess body fat, not just body weight.  
- Commonly measured using BMI (≥30 in adults) but waist circumference and WHR are better predictors of health risks.  
- Strongly linked to diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and certain cancers.  
- Management focuses on lifestyle changes, medications, and in some cases surgery.  

## Background
Global obesity rates have tripled since 1975. The condition is driven by an interplay of genetics, environment, diet, physical activity, and socioeconomic factors. Obesity is more than appearance — it’s a major driver of chronic disease worldwide.

## Causes or Mechanisms
- **Energy imbalance**: calories consumed vs. calories burned.  
- **Hormonal regulation**: insulin, leptin, and gut hormones affect appetite and fat storage.  
- **Environment**: availability of calorie-dense food, sedentary lifestyles.  
- **Genetics and epigenetics**: predispositions influence metabolism and fat storage.  

## Diagnosis / Options
- **BMI**: ≥25 = overweight, ≥30 = obese.  
- **Waist circumference / WHR**: stronger predictors of cardiovascular risk.  
- **Treatment**: nutrition and exercise, behavioral therapy, medications (e.g. GLP-1 agonists), bariatric surgery.  

## Risks / Prognosis
- Increased risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, osteoarthritis, and reduced life expectancy.  
- Prognosis improves with modest weight loss (5–10%), reduced waist circumference, and healthier fat distribution.  

## FAQ
**Q: Can you be obese but healthy?**  
A: Some people with obesity have normal blood pressure, glucose, and cholesterol. However, the risk of chronic disease is still higher than in those without obesity.  

**Q: Is BMI enough?**  
A: No. Waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio provide additional insight into risk.
