## Intro
Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the persistent inability to achieve or maintain an erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. It can affect quality of life and may signal underlying health issues.

## Key Points
- Common in men over 40 but can occur at any age.  
- Physical, psychological, and lifestyle factors may contribute.  
- Diagnosis involves history, physical exam, and blood tests.  
- Treatment ranges from lifestyle changes to medications, devices, and surgery.  

## Background
ED is not just a sexual health problem; it often reflects broader vascular or metabolic disease. Addressing ED can improve overall health outcomes.

## Causes or Mechanisms
- **Physical causes**: cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, low testosterone, medication side effects.  
- **Psychological causes**: stress, anxiety, depression, relationship issues.  
- **Lifestyle factors**: smoking, alcohol, lack of exercise.  

## Diagnosis / Treatment / Options
- **Diagnosis**: history, questionnaires, hormone and glucose testing, penile Doppler ultrasound if needed.  
- **First-line treatment**: lifestyle modification, oral PDE5 inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil).  
- **Other options**: vacuum erection devices, penile injections, testosterone therapy (if low T), implants for refractory cases.  

## Risks / Prognosis
- ED may improve with treatment of underlying conditions.  
- Prognosis is good with appropriate management; untreated ED may worsen quality of life and relationships.
