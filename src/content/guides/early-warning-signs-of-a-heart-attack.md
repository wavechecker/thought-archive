Heart attacks don't always start with sudden, crushing chest pain.  
In many cases, **subtle symptoms** appear hours or even days before.

### Common early warning signs
1. **Chest discomfort** — pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain that comes and goes.
2. **Pain in other areas** — discomfort in the arms, back, neck, jaw, or stomach.
3. **Shortness of breath** — with or without chest discomfort.
4. **Unusual fatigue** — especially in women, this can precede other symptoms.
5. **Nausea, lightheadedness, or cold sweats**.

### What to do
- **Call emergency services immediately** — don't wait to see if symptoms go away.
- **Chew aspirin** (unless allergic or advised not to) while waiting for help.
- **Stay calm and still** — moving around can worsen heart strain.

Early recognition saves lives — act fast if you or someone else may be having a heart attack.
