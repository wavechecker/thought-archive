## Intro
Hepatitis B is a viral infection that can cause chronic liver disease, cirrhosis and liver cancer. Infants infected early in life have the highest risk of chronic infection.

To prevent this, many countries recommend a **hepatitis B vaccine dose at birth**, with further doses given during infancy. Others reserve the birth dose for high-risk infants and begin routine doses later.

For a broader overview of hepatitis B, see:  
👉 [/guides/hepatitis-b](/guides/hepatitis-b)

## Key Points
- Early-life hepatitis B infection carries a high risk of chronic disease.  
- A birth dose provides early protection and acts as a safety net.  
- WHO recommends universal birth dose; some countries use selective dosing.  
- All infants should complete a full hepatitis B series.  
- Australia continues to recommend a universal birth dose.

## Background
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infects the liver. Infants exposed during birth or early childhood have a high chance of developing chronic infection, which can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer decades later.

## Causes or Mechanisms
- Infants are immunologically immature and often fail to clear the virus.  
- The vaccine contains HBsAg, which triggers protective antibodies without causing disease.  
- A birth dose extends protection into the earliest, highest-risk period of life.

## Diagnosis / Treatment / Options

### High-risk infants
- Vaccine within 24 hours  
- HBIG within 12 hours  
- A full 3–4 dose series

### Lower-risk infants
Depending on the country:
- **Universal birth dose** (common in Australia, US historically, many parts of Asia), or  
- **Delayed first dose at 6–8 weeks** for low-risk infants (common in some European systems)

### US policy shift
For a full breakdown of the recent US controversy:

### Completing the series
Regardless of birth dose timing, all infants should complete the series at 2, 4, and 6 months (or equivalent combination schedule).

## Risks / Benefits / Prognosis

### Benefits
- Early protection against a high-risk infection  
- Prevents mother-to-child and early household transmission  
- Provides a margin of safety when maternal testing is incomplete

### Risks
- Mild redness or fever  
- Serious adverse reactions are extremely rare

### Prognosis without vaccination
- High likelihood of lifelong infection  
- Risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer later in life

### Additional Parent Guidance

<StratBox type="tip" title="Questions parents can ask about the hepatitis B birth dose">
- **“Is my baby at higher risk for hepatitis B?”**  
- **“What are the benefits of giving the vaccine in the first 24 hours?”**  
- **“What are the risks or side effects of the vaccine in newborns?”**  
- **“What happens if we delay the first dose until 6–8 weeks?”**  
- **“How do we make sure my baby completes the full vaccine series?”**  
- **“If this were your baby, what would you do?”**  

> These questions support informed decision-making — not pressure toward any specific choice.
