## Intro
Protein is the foundation of lean tissue, metabolic health, and recovery. Adequate intake preserves muscle mass, stabilizes blood glucose, and supports long-term weight management.

## Key Points
- Aim for **1.6–2.2 g/kg body weight per day** for optimal muscle maintenance.  
- Evenly distribute protein across 3–4 meals to maximize muscle synthesis.  
- Combine with resistance training and adequate calories for best results.  
- Both plant and animal proteins can meet requirements with proper variety.

## Background
Muscle protein synthesis (MPS) requires essential amino acids — particularly leucine — to trigger repair and growth. As people age or reduce calorie intake, MPS efficiency declines, making protein intake even more crucial. Balanced intake reduces sarcopenia and improves metabolic rate.

## Mechanisms
- **Stimulates MPS:** amino acids trigger cellular repair and regeneration.  
- **Improves body composition:** preserves muscle while reducing fat mass.  
- **Supports metabolic flexibility:** stabilizes glucose and appetite control.  
- **Boosts thermogenesis:** digestion and metabolism of protein slightly raise daily energy expenditure.

## Recommendations
| Goal | Recommended Intake |
|------|--------------------|
| General health | 1.2–1.6 g/kg/day |
| Muscle gain / resistance training | 1.6–2.2 g/kg/day |
| Weight loss (preserve muscle) | 1.8–2.4 g/kg/day |

Divide protein evenly across meals (≈25–40 g per meal). Post-exercise intake enhances recovery.

## Sources
- **Animal:** eggs, chicken, fish, beef, dairy, whey protein  
- **Plant:** soy, lentils, tofu, chickpeas, quinoa, peas  

Vegetarians can combine complementary plant proteins to meet amino acid needs.

## Safety and Side Effects
Protein is safe for most people. Myths about kidney damage stem from misapplied renal-disease research. Staying hydrated and balancing fiber helps digestion. Excess protein may displace other nutrients if total calories are restricted too tightly.

## Risks / Benefits / Prognosis
**Benefits:**  
- Maintains muscle and metabolic health  
- Improves satiety and weight control  
- Supports immunity and recovery  

**Risks:**  
- Minimal in healthy adults; digestive discomfort if extremely high intake  

**Prognosis:**  
Adequate protein is essential for healthy aging, body composition, and long-term metabolic stability.

## FAQ
**Q: Can protein help with fat loss?**  
A: Yes. Protein increases satiety and helps retain lean mass while reducing fat.  

**Q: What time of day is best to eat protein?**  
A: Evenly spaced through the day — not just post-workout — to maximize synthesis.  

**Q: Are plant proteins enough?**  
A: Yes, when combined (e.g., beans + rice, soy + grains) to cover all amino acids.  

**Q: Do older adults need more protein?**  
A: Often yes — anabolic resistance means older adults should target the higher end (1.8–2.2 g/kg/day).
