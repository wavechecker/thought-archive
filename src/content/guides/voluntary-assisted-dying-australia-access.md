# Voluntary Assisted Dying in Australia — How to Access It

## Intro
Voluntary Assisted Dying (VAD) is now legal in every Australian state, but the exact rules and process vary. This guide explains **who qualifies, how to apply, and what differs between states and territories**.  

---

## Key Points
- **All six states** (VIC, WA, TAS, SA, QLD, NSW) now allow VAD.  
- **Territories (ACT and NT)** do *not yet* have laws in force, though bills are advancing.  
- Eligibility generally requires:  
  - Incurable, advanced disease or illness, expected to cause death within 6–12 months.  
  - Ongoing, intolerable suffering.  
  - Decision-making capacity and voluntary consent.  
- The process involves **two medical assessments**, a **written request**, and usually a **cooling-off period**.  

---

## State-by-State Access

### Victoria (first state, since 2019)
- Eligibility: terminal illness, death expected within **6 months** (12 for neurodegenerative).  
- Must be an **adult Australian citizen or permanent resident**, living in VIC for ≥12 months.  
- Process: request → two assessments → written declaration → waiting period (9 days unless exemption).  

### Western Australia (since 2021)
- Similar to VIC, but doctors may raise VAD with patients.  
- Death expected within **6 months** (12 for neurodegenerative).  

### Tasmania (since 2022)
- Longer application timeline: mandatory **four requests** (two verbal, one written, final confirmation).  
- Access overseen by the **Commission of Voluntary Assisted Dying**.  

### South Australia (since 2023)
- Modeled closely on VIC law.  
- Independent **SA VAD Review Board** oversees all cases.  

### Queensland (since 2023)
- Slightly broader access:  
  - **12-month life expectancy** applies to all illnesses, not just neurodegenerative.  
  - More flexible residency requirements.  

### New South Wales (since 2023–24)
- Most recent state.  
- Life expectancy: **6 months** (12 for neurodegenerative).  
- Process overseen by **NSW Voluntary Assisted Dying Board**.

## Territories (not yet)
- **ACT**: Passed VAD legislation in 2024, expected to commence around **2026**.  
- **Northern Territory**: Working on draft law; no access currently.  

---

## How the Process Works
1. **First request**: Patient raises VAD with their doctor.  
2. **Eligibility assessment**: Two independent doctors confirm criteria.  
3. **Written declaration**: Signed in front of witnesses.  
4. **Final request**: After waiting period, patient reconfirms decision.  
5. **Administration**: Patient usually self-administers medication; doctor may assist if unable.  

---

## Patient Considerations
- **Residency requirement**: Must live in the state for ≥12 months.  
- **Mental health checks**: If doubt exists, referral to psychiatrist or psychologist.  
- **Palliative care**: Patients are informed about alternatives and can withdraw anytime.  
- **Cost**: Generally no fee; medications provided through health system.

## FAQ
**Q: Can interstate patients travel to access VAD?**  
A: No. You must meet the 12-month residency requirement in the state where you apply.  

**Q: Can doctors refuse?**  
A: Yes. Conscientious objection is protected, but doctors must provide referral pathways.  

**Q: What if someone loses capacity?**  
A: VAD requires decision-making capacity at all stages. Advance directives cannot be used to request VAD.  

**Q: Are there appeals if rejected?**  
A: Limited. Patients may seek second opinions, but boards oversee compliance strictly.
