A fever is a temporary rise in body temperature, often a sign of infection — but some fevers require urgent care.

**Summary**  
The danger level depends on age, symptoms, and underlying health.

## Adults — seek urgent care if:

- Temp **>40°C (104°F)**  
- Confusion or difficulty breathing  
- Persistent vomiting  
- Severe headache or stiff neck

## Children — seek urgent care if:

- Temp **>38°C (100.4°F)** in infants under 3 months  
- Persistent crying or irritability  
- Rash that doesn’t fade when pressed  
- Seizures

## Self-care for mild fevers

- Stay hydrated  
- Rest  
- Use fever-reducing meds if uncomfortable (per instructions)
