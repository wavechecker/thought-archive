## Intro
Fever is a temporary rise in body temperature, usually due to infection. Most fevers are not dangerous by themselves, but **how the person looks and associated symptoms** matter. This guide helps you decide when to treat at home and when to seek urgent care.

## Key Points
- Typical fever: **≥38.0°C** (100.4°F).  
- **See a clinician urgently** for red flags (below), regardless of the exact number.  
- In babies under 3 months, any fever **≥38.0°C** warrants **same-day medical review**.  
- Hydration, comfort, and monitoring are more important than chasing a “normal” number.

## What Counts as a Fever?
- **Oral/tympanic/temporal:** ≥38.0°C (100.4°F)  
- **Axillary (underarm):** ~0.5°C lower than core readings; confirm with another method if high.

## Red Flags — Seek Urgent Care Now
**Any age:**
- Severe headache/neck stiffness, confusion, fainting, seizures.
- Shortness of breath, chest pain, blue/gray lips or skin.
- Severe dehydration (very dry mouth, no urine ≥8–12h), persistent vomiting.
- Non-blanching rash (doesn’t fade when pressed), rapidly spreading rash.
- Recent chemotherapy, transplant, long-term steroids, or immune problems.
- Recent travel to malaria/dengue areas with fever.

**Adults (≥18 years):**
- Temp **≥40.0°C (104°F)** or **≥38.0°C** lasting >3 days with no improvement.
- Worsening pain in one area (chest, abdomen, back, flank, joints).

**Children:**
- **<3 months:** **Any fever ≥38.0°C (100.4°F)** → **urgent medical review**.
- **3–6 months:** ≥39.0°C (102.2°F) or looks unwell → same-day review.
- **Any age child:** lethargic, inconsolable, stiff neck, labored breathing, poor intake/urine, seizure.

## Common Causes
- Viral infections (cold/flu, COVID-19, RSV).
- Bacterial infections (ear/throat, pneumonia, urinary tract, skin).
- Less common: inflammatory diseases, heat illness, medication reactions.

## Home Care & Monitoring
- **Fluids:** frequent small sips; breast/formula as normal for infants.
- **Comfort:** light clothing, tepid room (avoid ice baths or alcohol rubs).
- **Medicine (if uncomfortable):**
  - **Paracetamol/acetaminophen** per label/doctor dose.
  - **Ibuprofen** (if age-appropriate, not dehydrated, no kidney/stomach issues).
  - **Avoid aspirin** in children/teens.
- **Recheck** temperature and how the person looks every few hours.
- **Do not** withhold food/fluids; focus on hydration and rest.

## When to See a Clinician (Non-urgent but Soon)
- Fever **>3 days** without clear source.
- Recurrent fevers over weeks.
- New localized symptoms (ear pain, sore throat, cough, urinary pain, skin redness).

## How to Measure Accurately
- Use a **digital thermometer**; follow the device’s instructions.
- For infants, rectal or temporal artery readings are more reliable than underarm.
- Take the reading **after** resting indoors for 15 minutes.

## FAQ
**Is the fever number itself dangerous?**  
Usually no — fever is part of the immune response. The **cause** and **red flags** guide urgency.

**Should I alternate paracetamol and ibuprofen?**  
Only if advised by a clinician. Use **one** correctly dosed medicine first.

**Can teething cause a high fever?**  
Teething may cause slight warmth, but not high fever. Look for other causes.
