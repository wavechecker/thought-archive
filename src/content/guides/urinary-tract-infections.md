## Intro
A urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common bacterial infection of the bladder, urethra, or kidneys. Women are much more likely to get UTIs because of their anatomy. Most are mild and easily treated, but some can spread and become life-threatening if not managed quickly.

## Key Points
- Very common in women; often caused by *E. coli* from the gut.  
- Classic symptoms: burning when urinating, urgency, frequent urination, cloudy or strong-smelling urine.  
- **Red flags:** fever, chills, flank/back pain, nausea, vomiting, or blood in urine → possible kidney infection.  
- Most treated effectively with a short antibiotic course.  
- Prevention: hydration, urinating after sex, wiping front-to-back, avoiding unnecessary antibiotics.  

## Background
The urinary tract includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. Bacteria usually enter via the urethra and multiply in the bladder. If untreated, the infection can spread upward to the kidneys.

## Causes or Risk Factors
- Female anatomy (shorter urethra, proximity to anus).  
- Sexual activity.  
- Low fluid intake or infrequent urination.  
- Menopause (lower estrogen, changes in protective vaginal bacteria).  
- Catheter use or structural urinary tract problems.  

## Diagnosis and Treatment
- **Diagnosis:** often clinical based on symptoms; urine dipstick or culture may confirm.  
- **Treatment:** most women respond well to short-course antibiotics (e.g., nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim, fosfomycin).  
- **Relief:** pain control with ibuprofen/acetaminophen, hydration, sometimes urinary analgesics.  
- **Recurrent UTIs:** may need longer-term prevention (low-dose antibiotics, vaginal estrogen, or lifestyle changes).  

## Prevention
- Drink plenty of water and urinate regularly.  
- Urinate after sexual activity.  
- Wipe front-to-back after using the toilet.  
- Avoid excessive use of perfumed soaps or douches.  
- Post-menopause: discuss vaginal estrogen with your doctor if UTIs are frequent.  

## Risks and Prognosis
- Most cases resolve fully with treatment.  
- Untreated infections can progress to kidney infection (pyelonephritis) or sepsis.  
- Recurrent infections can affect quality of life but rarely cause lasting damage if managed properly.  

## FAQ
**Q: When should I see a doctor urgently?**  
A: If you have fever, chills, flank or back pain, vomiting, or blood in your urine. These can indicate a kidney infection.  

**Q: Do men get UTIs too?**  
A: Yes, but less often. In men, a UTI often suggests an underlying issue (e.g., prostate enlargement) and should be reviewed.  

**Q: Can UTIs clear on their own?**  
A: Some very mild cases improve without treatment, but antibiotics are usually recommended to prevent complications.  

**Q: Do cranberry products help?**  
A: Evidence is mixed. They may reduce recurrence for some women, but they are not a substitute for antibiotics if infection develops.
