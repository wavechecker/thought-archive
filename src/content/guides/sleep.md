# Sleep and Mental Health

*[← Back to Toolkit](/guides/mental-health-toolkit)*

Sleep is one of the strongest predictors of mental well-being. Poor sleep is linked to higher risk of depression, anxiety, and relapse.

## Why Sleep Matters

- Regulates mood and emotional stability  
- Supports learning, memory, and concentration  
- Restores immune and metabolic systems  

Even a single night of poor sleep can increase irritability and stress reactivity. Chronic disruption raises the risk of depression, anxiety, and burnout.

## Practical Tips

- Aim for **7–9 hours per night**  
- Keep a **consistent sleep schedule**, even on weekends  
- Make the bedroom **cool, dark, and quiet**  
- Limit caffeine and screens in the evening

## When to Seek Help

Persistent insomnia can often be improved with **cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I)** — the gold standard, more effective long term than sleeping pills.  

If poor sleep is worsening mental health, ask a clinician about targeted treatment.
