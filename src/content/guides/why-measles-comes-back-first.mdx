## The Pattern
Across decades and countries, measles is consistently the first disease to resurge when vaccination coverage drops.

This is not coincidence.

---

## What Makes Measles Different
- Airborne transmission
- Extremely high contagiousness
- Short exposure time required
- High immunity threshold

## Herd Immunity Thresholds
Most infections tolerate partial immunity.

Measles does not.

When population immunity falls even slightly below required thresholds, outbreaks occur rapidly and visibly.

---

## Why This Matters in 2026
Policy language often changes before behavior does — but behavior changes before data catches up.

Measles acts as an early signal that protection levels are slipping.

---

## Key Takeaway
Measles resurgence is not a failure of modern medicine.

It is a predictable response to reduced immunity.
