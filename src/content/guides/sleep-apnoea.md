## Intro
Sleep apnoea is a common but underdiagnosed condition where breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep. It disrupts sleep quality and places strain on the heart and circulation.

## Key Points
- Loud snoring and daytime sleepiness are hallmark signs.  
- Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is most common and linked to airway collapse.  
- Untreated sleep apnoea raises risks for high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, and diabetes.  
- Diagnosis requires a sleep study.  
- CPAP therapy is the gold standard treatment, but lifestyle changes also help.  

## Types of Sleep Apnoea
- **Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA):** Airway collapses or is blocked during sleep.  
- **Central Sleep Apnoea:** Brain fails to send proper signals to breathing muscles.  
- **Mixed/Complex Sleep Apnoea:** Features of both OSA and central apnoea.  

## Causes and Risk Factors
- Obesity, large neck circumference, nasal obstruction.  
- Alcohol, sedatives, and smoking.  
- Age (more common in middle-aged and older adults).  
- Family history.  
- Neurological conditions (central apnoea).  

## Diagnosis
- **Polysomnography (sleep study):** Measures breathing, oxygen, and sleep cycles.  
- **Home sleep testing:** Portable devices for convenience.  
- **Severity is measured** using the Apnoea-Hypopnoea Index (AHI).  

## Treatment
- **Lifestyle:** weight loss, avoiding alcohol/sedatives, sleeping on your side.  
- **CPAP:** continuous positive airway pressure to keep the airway open.  
- **Oral appliances:** reposition jaw/tongue.  
- **Surgery:** for anatomical blockages or severe cases.  

## Risks and Prognosis
- Untreated OSA leads to cardiovascular disease, diabetes, accidents, and reduced quality of life.  
- With treatment, risks fall dramatically, and energy, mood, and long-term outcomes improve.
