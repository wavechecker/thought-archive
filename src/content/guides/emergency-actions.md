# Emergency Actions — Hypos, Highs, and Ketones

## Severe hypo (can't swallow / unconscious / seizure)
- **Do not** give food or fluids by mouth.
- **Glucagon** (nasal or injection) if available and trained.
- **Call emergency services.**
- Once awake: longer‑acting carbs; contact your diabetes team.

## High BGL with ketones (sick day)
- **Hydrate** with unsweetened fluids; small sips every 5–10 minutes.
- **Correction insulin** per your plan; recheck BGL and ketones in 1–2 hours.
- **Pump users:** give correction by pen/syringe and **change the set** if ketones present.
- **Seek urgent care** if ketones ≥ **3.0 mmol/L**, rising ketones, or **vomiting, pain, drowsiness, rapid breathing**.

## Vomiting / unable to keep fluids down
- High risk for **DKA** even if BGL isn't very high. Try small frequent sips; if not tolerated, **seek urgent help**.
- **Do not stop basal insulin.**

## Driving safety
- If you feel low or CGM alarms low → **pull over and treat.**
- Don't drive again until BGL has clearly recovered **and** you feel well.

## Emergency kit checklist
- Glucose tablets/gel; small juice or regular soft drink  
- Glucagon (check expiry); quick instructions  
- Meter/strips or CGM; **blood ketone** strips/meter  
- Spare pen needles/syringes; pump set  
- Copy of your plan + **emergency contacts**
