# ADHD in Preschoolers — Why Behavioral Support Comes Before Medication

## Intro

A large study published in *JAMA Network Open* (2025) found that nearly **70% of U.S. preschoolers (ages 3–5) diagnosed with ADHD were prescribed medication before age 7**, and over **40% started within 30 days of diagnosis**.  
This goes against expert guidelines, which recommend **behavioral interventions first**, not medication, in this young age group.

---

## Key Points

- ADHD affects about **1–2% of preschool-aged children**.  
- **Guidelines (AAP, 2019):**  
  - First-line treatment for ages 4–5 is **parent training in behavior management**.  
  - Classroom supports and behavioral strategies should be tried before medication.  
  - **Methylphenidate (a stimulant)** is considered only if behavioral treatment fails or is unavailable.  
- In practice, many children are prescribed stimulants within weeks of diagnosis.  
- Medication rates and timing vary by race, ethnicity, and insurance status.  

---

## Why This Matters

Early medication may bypass effective non-drug options that build long-term skills.  
- **Behavioral approaches** help children learn self-regulation and social skills.  
- **Medication** mainly manages symptoms and does not teach new coping skills.  

Researchers also highlight barriers to behavioral therapy: cost, waitlists, and lack of local programs. These gaps often lead families to medication as the faster option.

## Recommended First-Line Strategies

- **Parent Training in Behavior Management**  
  Programs such as Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT), Triple P (Positive Parenting Program), and Incredible Years help parents respond consistently and effectively.  

- **Classroom and Preschool Supports**  
  - Structured routines and visual schedules.  
  - Frequent breaks and opportunities for movement.  
  - Positive reinforcement and clear expectations.  

- **Address Overlapping Issues**  
  Sleep problems, language delays, or learning difficulties often contribute to inattention or hyperactivity. Managing these can reduce ADHD-like symptoms.  

---

## When Medication Is Considered

If symptoms remain severe despite behavioral strategies, a **short trial of methylphenidate** may be recommended.  
- Treatment goals should be set in advance.  
- Side effects (appetite, sleep, mood) must be monitored closely.  
- Follow-up visits should occur within weeks of starting medication.  

---

## Bottom Line

Medication has a role in managing ADHD, but in preschoolers, it should come **after** structured behavioral approaches have been tried. Parents should ask about behavioral options and advocate for support before starting a prescription.
