# Hypoglycaemia — Fast Treatment Guide

## Recognizing a hypo
- Shakiness, sweating, hunger, irritability, blurred vision.  
- Severe: confusion, seizure, unconsciousness.

## 15:15 rule
- **15 g fast carbs** (e.g., glucose tablets, small juice, 6 jellybeans).  
- Wait **15 minutes** → recheck BGL.  
- Repeat if still < 4 mmol/L.

## Follow-up
- Eat longer-acting carbs (sandwich, milk, fruit) once stable.  
- Review cause (too much insulin, delayed meal, exercise).

## Prevention tips
- Don't skip meals.  
- Adjust insulin for exercise.  
- Carry glucose everywhere.
