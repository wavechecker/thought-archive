## Intro
Sepsis is a medical emergency that happens when the body’s response to an infection spirals out of control, damaging tissues and organs. Without rapid treatment, it can progress to septic shock and become fatal. Early recognition and intervention are critical.

## Key Points
- Sepsis is a **life-threatening reaction to infection**.
- Common triggers include pneumonia, urinary tract infections, abdominal infections, and bloodstream infections.
- Symptoms: fever, rapid breathing, confusion, low blood pressure, decreased urine output.
- Severe cases can lead to **septic shock**, multi-organ failure, and death.
- Prompt **hospital treatment with antibiotics, IV fluids, and oxygen** is essential.

## Background
Normally, the immune system fights infections locally. In sepsis, the response spreads systemically, releasing chemicals into the bloodstream that cause widespread inflammation, leaky blood vessels, and impaired circulation. This leads to organ dysfunction.

## Causes or Mechanisms
Sepsis can be triggered by:
- **Bacterial infections** (most common).
- **Viral infections** (e.g., influenza, COVID-19).
- **Fungal infections** (especially in immunocompromised patients).

High-risk groups include the elderly, infants, people with weakened immune systems, and those with chronic diseases (diabetes, kidney disease, cancer).

## Diagnosis / Treatment / Options
**Diagnosis:**
- Based on vital signs, blood tests (lactate, white cell count), cultures, and organ function tests.
- Imaging (X-ray, CT, ultrasound) may be used to locate infection.

**Treatment:**
- **Immediate IV antibiotics** (within the first hour).
- **IV fluids** to stabilize blood pressure.
- **Oxygen therapy** and sometimes mechanical ventilation.
- **Vasopressors** if fluids alone cannot maintain blood pressure.
- **Source control**: draining abscesses, removing infected devices, or surgery.

## Risks / Prognosis
- Mortality rates are high, especially if diagnosis or treatment is delayed.
- Survivors may experience long-term effects, such as fatigue, organ dysfunction, or post-sepsis syndrome.
- Prognosis depends on age, underlying health, speed of treatment, and severity at presentation.

## FAQ
**Q: What’s the difference between sepsis and septic shock?**  
A: Septic shock is a severe form of sepsis where blood pressure remains dangerously low despite IV fluids. It carries the highest risk of death.  

**Q: Can sepsis be prevented?**  
A: Reducing infection risk through vaccination, good hygiene, prompt treatment of infections, and safe hospital practices helps prevent sepsis.  

**Q: Who is most at risk?**  
A: Infants, older adults, people with weakened immune systems, and patients with chronic conditions like diabetes, kidney disease, or cancer.  

**Q: When should I seek emergency care?**  
A: If someone with an infection develops confusion, difficulty breathing, low blood pressure, or a rapid decline in health—call emergency services immediately.
