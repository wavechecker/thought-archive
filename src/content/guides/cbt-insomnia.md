## Intro
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) is the most effective long-term treatment for chronic insomnia. Unlike sleeping pills, which only mask symptoms, CBT-I helps people change the thoughts and behaviors that perpetuate sleeplessness. It is recommended as the **first-line therapy** by major sleep and medical organizations worldwide.

## Key Points
- CBT-I is the **gold standard treatment** for persistent insomnia.  
- It usually involves **6–8 sessions** with a therapist or validated online program.  
- Techniques include **sleep restriction, stimulus control, cognitive restructuring, relaxation training, and sleep hygiene**.  
- Results are long-lasting, with most patients improving within 6–8 weeks.  
- Available in person, via telehealth, and through digital programs.  

## Background
Insomnia affects up to one-third of adults at some point, with 10% experiencing chronic insomnia. CBT-I was developed to directly target the underlying psychological and behavioral causes of insomnia rather than just providing temporary sedation.

## How CBT-I Works
CBT-I combines behavioral and cognitive techniques to break the cycle of sleeplessness:

1. **Sleep Restriction**  
   Reducing time in bed to match actual sleep duration, then gradually extending it as sleep improves.  

2. **Stimulus Control**  
   Training the brain to associate bed only with sleep and sex — not wakefulness, worry, or screens.  

3. **Cognitive Restructuring**  
   Identifying and challenging anxious or unrealistic sleep-related thoughts.  

4. **Relaxation Training**  
   Learning calming techniques such as progressive muscle relaxation, breathing exercises, or mindfulness.  

5. **Sleep Hygiene**  
   Optimizing the sleep environment and daily habits (light, temperature, caffeine, screens).  

## Diagnosis / Treatment / Options
- **Professional therapy:** Delivered by psychologists or sleep specialists.  
- **Digital CBT-I:** Online platforms like Sleepio or SHUTi, which guide users step by step.  
- **Telehealth:** Many providers now offer CBT-I remotely.  

## Risks / Benefits / Prognosis
- **Benefits:** Durable improvement, no risk of dependency, fewer side effects than medications.  
- **Risks:** Initial sleep restriction may cause short-term tiredness, but usually improves within weeks.  
- **Prognosis:** Most patients improve significantly and sustain results long after treatment ends.  

## FAQ
**Q: How long does CBT-I take?**  
A: Most programs last 6–8 weeks, with improvements often noticed by week 2 or 3.  

**Q: Can I do CBT-I online?**  
A: Yes, several evidence-based programs are available digitally and can be as effective as in-person therapy.  

**Q: Is CBT-I better than sleeping pills?**  
A: Yes. Pills may help in the short term but do not address root causes. CBT-I is proven more effective long term.
