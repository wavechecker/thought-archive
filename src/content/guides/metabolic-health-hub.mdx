## Metabolic Health & Weight-Loss Medicines Hub

Metabolic health refers to how well the body regulates energy, blood glucose, blood pressure, and blood lipids. It is shaped by the interplay of hormones, organ function, physical activity, diet, sleep, and genetics. When these systems fall out of balance, the risk of conditions such as Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and fatty liver disease increases -- often long before any single diagnosis is made.

Obesity is one of the most visible and well-studied manifestations of metabolic dysfunction, but it is not the whole picture. People at a healthy weight can have poor metabolic health, and not everyone with obesity develops metabolic complications. This hub focuses on the broader landscape: the medications, lifestyle foundations, and evidence that apply across the spectrum. For guides specifically addressing obesity as a condition -- including BMI, fat distribution, and metabolic syndrome -- see the [Obesity & Metabolic Health Hub](/guides/obesity-metabolic-health-hub/).

This hub brings together our guides on obesity, GLP-1 medications (such as Ozempic and Wegovy), muscle protection, and long-term weight management.

If you are considering weight-loss medicines, already taking a GLP-1 drug, or trying to understand the bigger picture of metabolic health, start here.

## Core Guides

### Ozempic & GLP-1 Cautions Guide
- **Link:** [/guides/ozempic-cautions](/guides/ozempic-cautions)  
- Focuses on the safety side: side effects, misuse, muscle loss, and what happens when you stop GLP-1 medications.

### Understanding GLP-1 Medications for Weight Loss
- **Link:** [/guides/ozempic-glp-1-guide](/guides/ozempic-glp-1-guide)  
- Explains how GLP-1 drugs work, who they’re for, expected benefits, and how they compare with other treatments.

### GLP-1 Side Effects: Evidence vs Myth
- **Link:** [/guides/glp-1-side-effects-evidence-vs-myth](/guides/glp-1-side-effects-evidence-vs-myth)
- Separates documented side effects from unsubstantiated claims circulating online.

### GLP-1 vs Bariatric Surgery
- **Link:** [/guides/glp-1-vs-bariatric-surgery](/guides/glp-1-vs-bariatric-surgery)
- Compares risks, outcomes, and trade-offs between pharmacological and surgical weight-loss approaches.

### GLP-1 Use in Non-Obese Adults
- **Link:** [/guides/glp-1-non-obese-use](/guides/glp-1-non-obese-use)
- Examines the evidence and considerations for GLP-1 use in people who are not clinically obese.

### Muscle Protection During Weight Loss
- **Link:** [/guides/muscle-preservation](/guides/muscle-preservation)
- Shows why preserving lean muscle is essential for long-term health, especially during GLP-1 therapy or aggressive dieting.

### Muscle Preservation on GLP-1 Medications
- **Link:** [/guides/muscle-preservation-glp-1](/guides/muscle-preservation-glp-1)
- Focuses specifically on strategies to mitigate lean-mass loss during GLP-1 therapy.

## Lifestyle Foundations

These guides (current or planned) support medication use with solid lifestyle habits:

- **Creatine for Muscle & Brain Health**  
  - Link: [/guides/creatine](/guides/creatine)  

- **Protein Intake for Healthy Weight Loss** *(planned)*  
  - How much protein you need, how to reach it, and why it matters for muscle and appetite.

- **Magnesium & Recovery** *(planned)*  
  - Sleep, stress, and muscle function.

- **Collagen & Joint Health** *(planned)*  
  - Where collagen fits (and doesn’t fit) in an evidence-based supplement plan.

## Why We Treat Obesity as a Chronic Condition

Obesity is not a simple “willpower” problem. It is driven by:

- genetics and biology  
- hormones and appetite signals  
- food environment and marketing  
- sleep, stress, and mental health  

GLP-1 medications work best as part of a **chronic-condition approach**, not a short-term fix.
