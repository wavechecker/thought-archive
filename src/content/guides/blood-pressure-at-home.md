## Intro
Home blood pressure monitoring is an effective way to track your heart health and manage high blood pressure (hypertension). Done properly, it can help guide treatment decisions and catch problems early. Done incorrectly, it can cause unnecessary worry.

## Key Points
- Use an **automatic upper-arm cuff** for the most reliable readings.  
- Rest quietly for 5 minutes before measuring.  
- Sit upright, feet flat, back supported, arm at heart level.  
- Record 2–3 readings, 1–2 minutes apart, at the same time each day.  
- Keep a log to share with your healthcare provider.  

## ✅ Reassurance
- A single high reading is **not always dangerous** — repeat measurements matter.  
- Normal fluctuations happen with stress, caffeine, or exercise.  
- Tracking trends over time is more useful than any one number.  

## 🚨 Red Flags
Seek urgent medical help if:  
- Your blood pressure is **180/120 mmHg or higher**, especially if you also have chest pain, shortness of breath, vision changes, or neurological symptoms.  
- You have repeated readings above **160/100 mmHg** with symptoms like headache, confusion, or weakness.  
- You feel unwell despite “normal” numbers (symptoms matter as much as readings).  

## Step-by-Step: How to Measure
1. **Prepare:** Avoid caffeine, smoking, or exercise 30 minutes before. Empty your bladder.  
2. **Position:** Sit with your back supported, feet flat, arm bare and supported at heart level.  
3. **Apply cuff:** Wrap snugly around upper arm, not over clothing.  
4. **Rest:** Sit quietly 5 minutes before pressing start.  
5. **Take readings:** Record 2–3 readings, 1–2 minutes apart. Note date, time, and results.  

## Understanding Results
- **Normal:** below 120/80 mmHg  
- **Elevated:** 120–129 systolic, <80 diastolic  
- **High (Hypertension Stage 1):** 130–139 / 80–89 mmHg  
- **High (Stage 2):** 140+ / 90+ mmHg  
- **Hypertensive crisis:** 180+ / 120+ mmHg — emergency

## Risks and Benefits
- Benefits: empowers patients, reduces “white coat effect,” improves long-term management.  
- Risks: overchecking, anxiety, misinterpretation of one-off numbers.  

## FAQ
**Q: Should I check my blood pressure every day?**  
A: For most people, 2–3 times per week is enough. Daily checks may be recommended when adjusting medications.  

**Q: Which arm should I use?**  
A: Usually the left arm. If your doctor advises otherwise, follow their instructions.  

**Q: Can wrist or finger monitors be used?**  
A: They are less accurate. Upper-arm cuffs are preferred.  

**Q: Does it matter what time of day I measure?**  
A: Yes — measure at the same time each day (morning or evening) for consistency.
