## Intro

**Cervical cancer** is a cancer that develops in the cells of the cervix—the lower part of the uterus that connects to the vagina. It is one of the most **preventable cancers** in modern medicine, yet it continues to cause significant illness and death worldwide.

The vast majority of cervical cancer cases are caused by persistent infection with **human papillomavirus (HPV)**. Because cervical cancer usually develops slowly over many years, **screening and early treatment can stop the disease before cancer ever forms**.

---

## Key Points

- Over **99% of cervical cancers** are linked to persistent high-risk HPV infection  
- Cervical cancer usually develops slowly over **10–15 years**  
- Screening detects precancerous changes long before symptoms appear  
- HPV vaccination dramatically reduces lifetime risk  
- Early-stage cervical cancer is highly treatable  

---

## Background

The cervix plays a critical role in reproduction, but it is also uniquely vulnerable to HPV infection. HPV is extremely common—most sexually active people will encounter it at some point in their lives.

In most cases, the immune system clears HPV naturally. When it does not, the virus can cause gradual cellular changes that may progress from **precancer → cancer** if left untreated.

This long window makes cervical cancer particularly suitable for prevention through routine screening.

---

## Causes and Risk Factors

### Primary Cause

- Persistent infection with **high-risk HPV types**, especially HPV-16 and HPV-18

### Additional Risk Factors

- Not participating in regular cervical screening  
- Smoking (reduces immune clearance of HPV)  
- Early onset of sexual activity  
- Multiple sexual partners (increases HPV exposure risk)  
- Long-term oral contraceptive use  
- Immunosuppression (e.g. HIV, organ transplant, chemotherapy)

---

## Screening and Diagnosis

### Screening Tests

- **Pap smear (cytology):** looks for abnormal cervical cells  
- **HPV test:** detects DNA from high-risk HPV strains  
- **Co-testing:** combines Pap smear and HPV testing (used in some regions)

Many countries are transitioning to **primary HPV testing**, as it detects cancer risk earlier than cytology alone.

### Diagnostic Follow-Up

If screening results are abnormal:
- Colposcopy (magnified examination of the cervix)  
- Cervical biopsy to confirm diagnosis  
- Imaging for staging if cancer is suspected  

---

## Treatment Options

Treatment depends on the stage of disease, age, fertility considerations, and overall health.

### Precancerous Changes

- Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP)  
- Cold knife conisation  
- Laser or ablative therapies  

### Early-Stage Cervical Cancer

- Surgery (fertility-sparing procedures or hysterectomy)  
- Sometimes combined with radiation  

### Advanced Cervical Cancer

- Radiation therapy  
- Chemotherapy  
- Targeted therapy or immunotherapy in selected cases  

---

## Prognosis

- **Very high survival rates** when detected early  
- Prognosis worsens as cancer spreads beyond the cervix  
- Regular screening is the single most important factor influencing outcomes  

With effective screening and vaccination, cervical cancer is considered a **potentially eliminable disease**.

---

## Prevention

### HPV Vaccination

- Protects against the most dangerous HPV strains  
- Recommended for adolescents and available for adults in many countries  
- Significantly reduces cervical cancer risk at a population level  

### Regular Screening

- Follow age-appropriate screening guidelines  
- Screening remains necessary even after vaccination  

### Lifestyle Measures

- Avoid smoking  
- Practice safer sex  
- Maintain immune health

## FAQ

**Q: Can cervical cancer develop without HPV?**  
A: Very rarely. More than 99% of cases are HPV-related.

**Q: If I feel well, do I still need screening?**  
A: Yes. Cervical cancer often causes no symptoms until late stages.

**Q: Does HPV vaccination remove the need for Pap smears or HPV tests?**  
A: No. Vaccines do not cover all cancer-causing HPV types.

**Q: Is cervical cancer hereditary?**  
A: There is no strong inherited genetic pattern, unlike some other cancers.
