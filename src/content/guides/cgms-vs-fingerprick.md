Monitoring blood glucose isn’t busywork — it’s what keeps you safe and gives you agency. Two tools dominate: the **finger‑prick meter** and the **continuous glucose monitor (CGM)**. They serve different purposes and, used together, cover each other’s blind spots.

## Finger‑Prick Testing (BGM)
**What it is:** a capillary blood test from the fingertip (or alternate site), giving a single reading.

**Strengths**
- **Accurate “now” value** with ISO‑standard meters.
- **Low cost** and **no warm‑up**, works anywhere.
- Not affected by most **compression** or **sensor warm‑ups**.

**Limitations**
- **No trends or alerts** — it’s a snapshot.
- Can miss overnight lows or rapid swings between checks.

**Where it shines**
- Confirming CGM readings during **rapid change**.
- **Pre‑driving**, **pre‑exercise**, illness/sick days.
- Troubleshooting: “Is my CGM right?” → do a meter check.

## Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs)
**What it is:** a small sensor under the skin measuring interstitial glucose every 1–5 minutes, streaming to a phone/reader; many offer alarms.

**Strengths**
- **24/7 visibility**: graphs, **trend arrows**, **time‑in‑range**.
- **Alerts** for highs/lows — especially valuable **overnight**.
- Enables smarter dosing (pre‑bolus timing), exercise planning, and learning patterns.

**Limitations**
- **Lag vs blood** during rapid rises/falls (interstitial fluid delay).
- **Warm‑up periods**, **adhesive issues**, occasional sensor failures.
- **Cost**; availability and subsidy vary by country.

**Where it shines**
- Preventing **severe hypos**, spotting patterns, refining basal/bolus strategy.
- Powering **AID (automated insulin delivery)** with compatible pumps.

## CGM vs Meter: How to Combine
Think of CGM as the **weather radar** (direction + speed), and the meter as **looking out the window** (ground truth).

- Use **CGM day‑to‑day** for trends, alerts, and learning.  
- Use **meter** to **confirm** when:
  - Symptoms don’t match CGM.
  - Reading changes **very fast** (double‑arrow up/down).
  - First 12–24 h of a new sensor feels “off”.
  - Before **driving** if you’re unsure.
- If high **with ketones** (or unwell): rely on **meter** readings and follow your sick‑day plan.

## Practical Moves
- **Pre‑bolus**: aim insulin before the CGM line climbs; faster insulins may shorten the gap.  
- **Compression lows**: unexpected CGM low while lying on the sensor? Sit up, wait, or **finger‑prick confirm**.  
- **Sensor adhesion**: use over‑patches/skin prep; rotate sites to avoid irritation.  
- **Data sanity**: watch **time‑in‑range (TIR)**, **GMI**, and **coefficient of variation (CV)** — not just single numbers.

## Safety Notes
- Treat hypos **first**; debate accuracy later.  
- For pump users: if high + ketones, **inject correction by pen/syringe** and **change infusion set**.  
- Don’t ignore alarms at night; adjust thresholds if they’re too noisy, not off.
