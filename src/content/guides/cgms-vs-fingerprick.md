Checking your blood sugar is the foundation of diabetes management. Today, there are two main approaches: traditional finger-prick testing and continuous glucose monitoring.

**Finger-Prick Testing:**
- Inexpensive, portable, quick
- Gives a single reading at a moment in time

**Continuous Glucose Monitors:**
- Sensor under the skin measures glucose 24/7
- Data sent to a reader or smartphone
- Alerts for highs/lows, trend tracking

**Which Is Right for You?**
Many people use both — CGM for trends, finger-prick to confirm readings.
