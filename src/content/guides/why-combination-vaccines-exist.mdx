## Intro
Combination vaccines — like **MMR** (measles–mumps–rubella) and **DTaP-IPV-HepB-Hib** — protect against several diseases in a single shot.  
They were developed to make immunization simpler, safer, and more effective, not to “overload” the immune system.

## Key Points
- Combination vaccines **reduce the number of injections** and **clinic visits**.  
- They have **identical safety and immune response** to single-antigen vaccines.  
- Combining antigens **improves coverage**, especially in early childhood programs.  
- There is **no scientific basis** for separating MMR into three separate shots.  
- Fewer injections = better adherence = fewer outbreaks.

## Background
When vaccines were first introduced, each disease had its own vial and visit.  
As immunization programs expanded, this became logistically unworkable — and many children missed doses.  

By the early 1970s, combination vaccines like MMR were tested and approved after rigorous safety and immunogenicity studies.  
They were found to **produce the same antibody levels** and **no increase in side effects** compared to individual shots.

## Evidence Summary

### MMR (Measles–Mumps–Rubella)
- Studies in over **10 million children** show no increase in adverse events versus single vaccines.  
- **Measles seroconversion:** 95–98% with MMR (identical to single measles vaccine).  
- **Mumps & rubella:** equally strong antibody response.  
- No difference in fever or rash rates.

### DTaP-IPV-HepB-Hib (Pentavalent/Hexavalent)
- Reduces **4–6 injections to one** in infancy.  
- Equivalent antibody responses for all components.  
- No increase in fever, swelling, or irritability.

## Myths and Misconceptions

**Myth:** “Too many vaccines at once overload the immune system.”  
**Fact:** Babies naturally fight thousands of microbes daily.  
The total antigen exposure from all routine vaccines combined is far smaller than daily environmental exposure.

**Myth:** “Separate vaccines are safer.”  
**Fact:** No evidence supports this. Separate vaccines increase visits, delays, and costs — and raise the risk of incomplete protection.

**Myth:** “MMR should be split into three.”  
**Fact:** No manufacturer currently produces all three single vaccines.  
Splitting MMR would delay immunization and **increase disease risk** with zero safety gain.

## Risks / Benefits / Prognosis
- **Benefits:** Fewer injections, better coverage, lower costs, identical protection.  
- **Risks:** Same as any vaccine — mild fever or soreness, serious events exceedingly rare.  
- **Outlook:** Combination vaccines are now the global standard; reverting to separate doses would reduce coverage and increase outbreaks.

## FAQ
**Q: Can combination vaccines increase side effects?**  
A: No — large trials show no difference in safety outcomes.

**Q: Why not give them separately just to be “safe”?**  
A: Because “separate” means more visits, more missed doses, and no scientific benefit.

**Q: Who invented the MMR vaccine?**  
A: Dr. Maurice Hilleman and his team at Merck, licensed in 1971 after extensive testing for antigen stability and immune compatibility.

**Q: Is it possible to “undo” a combination vaccine?**  
A: No — each antigen is blended and stabilized together under specific conditions. There’s no reason, medically or scientifically, to do so.
