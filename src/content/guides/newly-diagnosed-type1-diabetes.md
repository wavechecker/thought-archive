Being told you have **Type 1 diabetes** can feel overwhelming. There's a lot to learn, new routines to build, and emotions to process. But with the right information, support, and daily habits, it is absolutely possible to live a full, healthy, and active life. Thousands of people around the world manage Type 1 diabetes successfully every day — and so can you.

## 1. Understanding Your Diagnosis
- **Type 1 diabetes** is an autoimmune condition. Your body no longer produces insulin, a hormone needed to move glucose (sugar) from your blood into your cells for energy.
- This is **not your fault** — it is not caused by diet, lifestyle, or anything you did.
- You will need insulin every day, either by injections or an insulin pump, for the rest of your life.
- With the right management, people with Type 1 can live long, healthy lives.

## 2. Your Care Team
- **Endocrinologist / Diabetes Specialist** – helps plan your insulin therapy and long-term care.
- **Diabetes Educator** – teaches you how to check blood glucose, give insulin, and manage food and activity.
- **Dietitian** – guides you on balanced eating and carbohydrate counting.
- **GP / Family Doctor** – supports your overall health.
- **Mental Health Support** – adjusting to a new diagnosis can be emotionally challenging. It's OK to ask for help.

## 3. Essential Skills to Learn Early
1. **Blood Glucose Testing** – learn how and when to check your levels.
2. **Insulin Administration** – pen injections or pump management.
3. **Carbohydrate Counting** – matching insulin doses to the carbs in your meals.
4. **Recognising Highs & Lows** –  
   - Low blood glucose (hypoglycaemia) – shakiness, sweating, confusion, weakness.  
   - High blood glucose (hyperglycaemia) – thirst, frequent urination, tiredness.
5. **Emergency Actions** – treating hypos quickly, checking for ketones during highs.

## 4. Emotional Wellbeing
- It's normal to feel fear, frustration, or sadness. You are learning to manage a life-long condition, and that takes time.
- Connecting with others who live with Type 1 can help. Many find online support groups, community programs, or diabetes camps helpful.
- Celebrate small wins — every step in learning your care routine is a success.

## 5. Lifestyle and Hope
- **Food** – You can enjoy most foods with planning and insulin adjustment.
- **Exercise** – Regular activity is encouraged but may require insulin/food adjustments.
- **Travel** – With preparation, you can go anywhere.
- **Technology** – Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs) and pumps can make management easier.
- You are *not* limited in what you can achieve — athletes, pilots, doctors, and world travellers live with Type 1.

## 6. Key Safety Reminders
- Always carry hypo treatment (like glucose tablets or juice).
- Wear medical ID stating you have Type 1 diabetes.
- Have a written diabetes plan for emergencies.
- Tell friends, family, and close colleagues how to help if you have a hypo.
- Seek medical help if you have **vomiting**, **very high blood glucose**, or **positive ketones**.
