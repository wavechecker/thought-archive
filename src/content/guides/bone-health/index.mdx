## Bone Health Hub

Bones provide structure, protect organs, store minerals, and allow us to move.  
As we age, keeping them strong becomes essential to prevent fractures and maintain independence.

This hub brings together key guides on how bones work, what happens when they weaken, and how to prevent and treat problems like osteoporosis.
