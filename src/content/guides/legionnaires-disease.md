Legionnaires’ disease is a **severe pneumonia** caused by *Legionella* bacteria. People get sick by **inhaling tiny water droplets** containing the bacteria — not from drinking water and **not from person-to-person spread** (extremely rare). Outbreaks often trace back to **poorly maintained water systems**.

## How infection happens
- **Aerosolized water** from cooling towers, decorative fountains, showers, hot tubs/spas, humidifiers, or complex plumbing.
- Bacteria thrive in **stagnant, warm water** (20–45°C / 68–113°F), biofilms, and scale.

## Symptoms & timing
- Starts **2–10 days** after exposure (occasionally up to 14 days).
- **High fever**, chills, **cough** (dry or productive), **shortness of breath**, chest pain.
- Often includes **headache**, **muscle aches**, **fatigue**, and sometimes **diarrhea** or **confusion**.

## Who is most at risk
- Age **50+**, **smokers**, people with **chronic lung disease**, **diabetes**, **kidney disease**, **cancer**, or weakened immunity.
- Recent **hotel/cruise stays**, **hospitalization**, or buildings with complex water systems.

## Prevention — practical steps
- Prefer **well-maintained** accommodations; look for good hygiene standards.
- Avoid or limit time near **steamy hot tubs** or **decorative fountains** in unclear maintenance settings.
- In rooms unused for a while, run the **shower hot** for a few minutes with the door closed before use.
- Facility owners should follow **water safety plans** (regular flushing, temperature control, biocide, sediment control).

## When to seek medical care
- **Pneumonia symptoms** (fever, cough, shortness of breath), especially after hotel/spa/cruise or healthcare exposure.
- Tell clinicians about **recent travel or exposure to water systems**; this helps trigger **Legionella testing**.
- Early diagnosis and **appropriate antibiotics** improve outcomes.
