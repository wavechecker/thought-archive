## Intro
Opioid overdoses can happen suddenly and silently. Knowing the warning signs — and how to respond — can mean the difference between life and death.

## Key Points
- Overdose = **not breathing or very slow breathing**.  
- **Call emergency services immediately** — time is critical.  
- **Administer naloxone (Narcan)** if available.  
- **Stay and support breathing** until help arrives.

## Recognizing the Signs
- Slow, irregular, or stopped breathing  
- Pinpoint pupils  
- Pale, clammy, or bluish skin (especially lips or fingertips)  
- Unconsciousness or inability to wake  
- Gurgling, snoring, or choking sounds  

If you see these signs: assume overdose and act fast.

## What to Do
1. **Call emergency services immediately.**  
2. **Administer naloxone.** Use nasal spray or injection form if trained.  
3. **Perform rescue breathing:**  
   - Tilt head back, lift chin, pinch nose, give one breath every 5 seconds.  
4. **Place the person in recovery position** (on their side) if breathing resumes.  
5. **Stay until help arrives.**  

If there’s no naloxone: continue rescue breathing and monitor closely.

## Aftercare
Even after revival, medical care is essential — naloxone wears off after 30–90 minutes, and respiratory depression can return.

## Prevention Tips
- Never use opioids alone.  
- Test substances for fentanyl when possible.  
- Avoid mixing opioids with alcohol, sedatives, or benzodiazepines.  
- Keep naloxone accessible and train family or friends to use it.

## FAQ
**Q: Can I get in trouble for calling emergency services?**  
A: Many regions have **Good Samaritan laws** protecting people who report overdoses.  

**Q: Can naloxone harm someone who isn’t overdosing?**  
A: No — it only reverses opioid effects.  

**Q: What if the person doesn’t wake up?**  
A: Continue rescue breathing and repeat naloxone every 2–3 minutes if available.
