# Recognising Highs and Lows — Symptoms and First Steps

## Why this matters
Early recognition keeps you safe and prevents severe events. Learn your personal warning signs and act promptly.

## Low blood glucose (hypoglycaemia)
**Common symptoms:** shaking, sweating, tingling lips, hunger, irritability, confusion, blurred vision, headache.  
**Immediate action:**  
1) **15 g fast-acting carbohydrate** (glucose tabs/gel, small juice/regular soft drink).  
2) **Recheck in 15 minutes**; repeat if still <4.0 mmol/L.  
3) Follow with a **longer-acting snack** if the next meal is >1 hour away.  
**Severe hypo:** unable to swallow/unconscious/seizure → **glucagon** if available + **call emergency services**.

## High blood glucose (hyperglycaemia)
**Common symptoms:** thirst, frequent urination, tiredness, blurred vision, headache.  
**Immediate action:**  
- Give a **correction dose** per your plan.  
- **Hydrate**, and **check ketones** if BGL ≥15 mmol/L or if you're unwell/vomiting.  
- **Pump users:** consider **site failure** — give correction by **pen/syringe** and **change set** if ketones present.

## Patterns and prevention
- Track events: before meals, after meals, overnight, with exercise, during illness.  
- Review **ICR**, correction factor, and **basal** with your team if patterns persist.  
- Consider technology (CGM/pump) or refresher education if you're struggling.

## When to seek help
- Repeated hypos or **loss of warning signs**  
- Persistent highs despite corrections  
- **Ketones** that are rising or **≥3.0 mmol/L**  
- Vomiting or symptoms suggestive of **DKA**
