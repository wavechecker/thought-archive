## Intro
Knowing the early signs of **low** (hypoglycaemia) and **high** (hyperglycaemia) blood glucose helps you treat quickly and avoid complications. This guide gives clear symptoms, numbers, and step-by-step actions.

## Key Points
- **Low (hypo):** usually **<3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL)**. Treat **immediately** with fast carbs.
- **High (hyper):** commonly **>13.9 mmol/L (250 mg/dL)**. Check **ketones** if very high or if unwell.
- CGM **trend arrows** matter as much as the number.
- Repeat hypoglycaemia or persistent highs → **review regimen** with your diabetes team.

## Hypoglycaemia (Low)
**Typical symptoms**
- Shaky, sweaty, hungry, tingling lips, palpitations  
- Headache, blurred vision, difficulty concentrating, irritability  
- Severe: confusion, drowsiness, seizures, unconsciousness

**Immediate treatment — Rule of 15**
1. Take **15–20 g fast carbs** (glucose tabs/gel, juice, regular soda).  
2. **Recheck in 15 minutes**.  
3. If still <3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL), repeat step 1.  
4. If the next meal is >1 hour away, add a **slow carb** (toast/crackers).  
5. If unconscious or can’t swallow: a trained person should give **glucagon** (nasal or injection) and call emergency services.

**Common triggers**
- Too much insulin / delayed meals  
- Exercise (during or up to 24h after)  
- Alcohol (especially without food)

## Hyperglycaemia (High)
**Typical symptoms**
- Thirst, frequent urination, tiredness  
- Blurred vision, headache  
- If very high: abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, deep/fast breathing (seek urgent care)

**What to do**
- If **>13.9 mmol/L (250 mg/dL)**:  
  - **Check ketones** (blood or urine) if you’re on insulin or feel unwell.  
  - If ketones are present: follow sick-day rules (fluids, correction insulin per plan) and seek advice if not improving.  
- Take a **correction dose** as per your plan; recheck in 2–3 hours.  
- Hydrate (water); avoid sugary drinks until back in range.

**Common triggers**
- Illness/infection, stress hormones  
- Missed insulin doses or pump/infusion set issues  
- Carb counting errors

## Monitoring & Trends
- **Finger-stick** remains the reference for rapid changes or when CGM readings don’t match how you feel.  
- Use **trend arrows** to act early (e.g., take carbs before a steep drop).  
- Log patterns: time of day, meals, exercise, alcohol, illness.

## Prevention
- Review **basal/bolus** ratios and timing with your team.  
- For exercise: plan **carbs/insulin adjustments**; beware of late-onset lows.  
- Rotate **infusion/sensor sites**; check for leaks or dislodgement.  
- Set sensible **CGM alerts** (overnight slightly higher for safety).

## When to Seek Medical Advice
- **Two or more severe hypos** (needing help) in any week.  
- Recurrent morning or overnight lows.  
- Persistent highs despite correction, or **positive ketones** that don’t settle.  
- Vomiting, abdominal pain, or breathing changes with high glucose.

## FAQ
**Do I always need to eat after correcting a low?**  
If the next meal is far away, add a small **slow carb** after you’re back above 3.9 mmol/L.

**Can stress alone raise glucose?**  
Yes—stress hormones can push levels higher; adjust with guidance if it becomes a pattern.

**Why do I wake up high after feeling low overnight?**  
Could be **rebound** after an untreated low or the **dawn phenomenon**—use overnight data to distinguish.
