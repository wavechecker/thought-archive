# Recognising Highs and Lows (Blood Glucose)

Knowing the early signs of **low (hypoglycaemia)** and **high (hyperglycaemia)** blood glucose helps you treat quickly and avoid complications. This guide gives clear symptoms, numbers, and step-by-step actions.

---

## 🚑 Bottom Line
- **Low = <3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL)** → treat immediately with **15 g fast carbs**.  
- **High = >13.9 mmol/L (250 mg/dL)** → check ketones, give correction insulin, hydrate.  
- If **severe symptoms, vomiting, or ketones ≥3.0 mmol/L** → **call emergency services**.  

---

## Hypoglycaemia (Low)

**Typical symptoms**
- Shaky, sweaty, hungry, tingling lips, palpitations  
- Headache, blurred vision, difficulty concentrating, irritability  
- Severe: confusion, drowsiness, seizures, unconsciousness  

**Immediate treatment — Rule of 15**
1. Take **15–20 g fast-acting carbs** (glucose tabs/gel, juice, regular soda).  
2. **Recheck in 15 minutes**.  
3. If still <3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL), repeat step 1.  
4. If the next meal is >1 hour away, add a **slow carb** (toast, crackers).  
5. ⚠️ If unconscious or unable to swallow: a trained person should give **glucagon** (nasal or injection) and call **emergency services**.  

**Common triggers**
- Too much insulin or delayed meals  
- Exercise (during or up to 24h after)  
- Alcohol (especially without food)

## Hyperglycaemia (High)

**Typical symptoms**
- Thirst, frequent urination, tiredness  
- Blurred vision, headache  
- If very high: abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, deep/fast breathing → **urgent care**  

**What to do**
- If **>13.9 mmol/L (250 mg/dL)**:  
  - **Check ketones** (blood or urine) if on insulin or unwell.  
  - If ketones are present: follow [Diabetes Emergency Actions](/guides/diabetes-emergency-actions).  
- Take a **correction dose** as per your plan; recheck in 2–3 hours.  
- Hydrate with water; avoid sugary drinks until back in range.  

**Common triggers**
- Illness/infection, stress hormones  
- Missed insulin doses or pump/infusion set issues  
- Carb counting errors  

---

## Monitoring & Trends
- **Finger-stick** remains the reference when CGM readings don’t match symptoms.  
- Use **trend arrows** to act early (e.g., carbs before a steep drop).  
- Log patterns: time of day, meals, exercise, alcohol, illness.  

---

## Prevention
- Review **basal/bolus** ratios and timing with your team.  
- Plan **carbs/insulin adjustments** around exercise; beware of delayed lows.  
- Rotate **infusion/sensor sites**; check for leaks or dislodgement.  
- Set **sensible CGM alerts** (overnight slightly higher for safety).  

---

## When to Seek Medical Advice
- Two or more **severe hypos** (needing help) in a week.  
- Recurrent morning or overnight lows.  
- Persistent highs despite corrections, or **positive ketones** not settling.  
- Vomiting, abdominal pain, or breathing changes with high glucose.  

---

## FAQ
**Do I always need to eat after correcting a low?**  
If your next meal is far away, yes—add a slow carb after recovering above 3.9 mmol/L.  

**Can stress raise glucose?**  
Yes. Stress hormones often push levels higher. Adjust with team guidance if it’s a pattern.  

**Why do I wake up high after a low?**  
Could be a **rebound** after an untreated low or the **dawn phenomenon**. Overnight CGM or a 3 a.m. finger-stick helps tell the difference.
