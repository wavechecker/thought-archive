faq:
  - q: "Can constipation really cause severe abdominal pain?"
    a: "Yes — constipation can cause significant abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, and even vomiting in children."
  - q: "Can my child still be constipated if they poop daily?"
    a: "Yes — some children pass small stools while still being constipated. Hard, painful stools, straining, and bloating are clues."
  - q: "Is soiling a sign of constipation?"
    a: "Often, yes — stool leakage or skid marks can happen when softer stool leaks around retained hard stool."
  - q: "How long does constipation take to improve?"
    a: "Treatment usually requires weeks to months, not days. Patience and consistency with fluids, routines, and softeners are key."
  - q: "When should a child with constipation be seen urgently?"
    a: "Seek urgent care for severe belly swelling, persistent vomiting, blood in stool with significant pain, dehydration, or if your child is very unwell."

## Intro

Constipation is **one of the most common causes of abdominal pain in children** — and one of the most frequently missed.

Children may still pass stools regularly and *still* be constipated. Pain, nausea, poor appetite, and even vomiting can result from stool retention.

---

## Key Points

- Constipation can cause **chronic or recurrent abdominal pain**
- Children may hide or deny stool problems
- Soiling does **not** rule constipation out — it often confirms it
- Treatment usually requires **weeks to months**, not days
- Untreated constipation increases anxiety and pain cycles

---

## Signs Parents Often Miss

- Large or painful bowel motions  
- Avoidance of toileting or “withholding”  
- Soiling or “skid marks” in underwear  
- Abdominal bloating or a “full” belly  
- Poor appetite or early fullness  
- Pain that improves after passing stool or gas  

---

## Why Constipation Hurts

When stool accumulates:
- The bowel stretches and loses sensitivity  
- Normal urge signals weaken  
- Liquid stool may leak around hard stool (soiling)  
- Pain becomes chronic and unpredictable  

This creates a **self-reinforcing loop**:

**pain → withholding → stool retention → more pain**

---

## The Constipation Cycle (Why it becomes chronic)

Many children with constipation aren’t “lazy” or “not trying.” They’re avoiding pain.

Common triggers:
- A single painful bowel motion
- Fear of using toilets at school
- Busy routines that reduce toilet time
- Low fluid intake during school days

Over time:
- The rectum stretches
- The urge to go becomes weaker
- Stools become larger and harder
- Accidents and embarrassment increase stress

This is why constipation often needs a **longer plan**, not a quick fix.

---

## Treatment Basics (General Guidance)

> Always follow clinician advice — this is educational, not prescriptive.

A typical approach includes:

- **Stool softeners** (often needed for longer than parents expect)
- **Adequate fluids**
- **Regular toilet routines** (often after meals)
- **Fibre introduced gradually** (too much too fast can worsen cramps/gas)
- **Avoid punishment or pressure** (it worsens withholding)

### A simple routine that helps many families

- Sit on the toilet **5 minutes after meals**
- Feet supported (small stool/box)
- Calm environment (no shame, no threats)
- Track frequency + stool consistency (even brief notes help)

---

## When to Seek Review

Seek medical review if:

- Pain persists despite constipation support
- Weight loss, poor appetite over time, or poor growth
- Persistent vomiting or dehydration
- Blood in stool with significant pain
- Severe abdominal distension
- Constipation starting in infancy
- Recurrent soiling that isn’t improving

---

## When to seek urgent care

Go to urgent care / ED if there is:

- Severe or rapidly worsening belly swelling
- Persistent vomiting with inability to keep fluids down
- Child is unusually drowsy, faint, or very unwell
- Severe abdominal pain that is worsening (especially if localised)
