# Mental Health — Guide Hub

Mental health conditions affect more than **one billion people worldwide**. They are a leading cause of disability, yet stigma, limited resources, and access barriers mean many go untreated. The hopeful reality is that effective treatments exist — from therapy and medication to lifestyle and community support. Recovery is possible, and **early intervention saves lives**.

This hub brings together our guides on crisis support, therapy, and **everyday strategies to build resilience and well-being**.
