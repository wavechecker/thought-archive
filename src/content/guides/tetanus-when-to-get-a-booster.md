**Tetanus** is caused by *Clostridium tetani* bacteria entering a wound and producing a toxin that affects the nervous system. The disease is rare where vaccination coverage is high — but **booster timing matters**, especially after injuries.

## Routine vaccination schedule (typical)
- Childhood primary series (as part of DTaP/Tdap schedules).
- **Adults:** a **Td or Tdap booster every 10 years** (local guidance may vary).

## After an injury — do I need a booster?
- Consider **time since last tetanus shot** and **wound type**:
  - **Clean, minor wound:** booster needed if **≥10 years** since last dose.
  - **Dirty or high‑risk wound** (soil, saliva, puncture, crush, burn, frostbite): booster if **≥5 years** since last dose.
- **Tetanus immune globulin (TIG)** may be recommended for **unvaccinated** or **uncertain history** with high‑risk wounds.

## Wound care basics
- Clean thoroughly with running water; remove debris.
- Seek care for deep, contaminated, or animal bite wounds.
- Animal bites may also require **rabies PEP** → see our rabies guide.

## Symptoms to watch for
- **Jaw stiffness (“lockjaw”)**, muscle spasms, trouble swallowing, headache, fever.
- Symptoms can appear from **3 days to 3 weeks** after injury (sometimes longer).

> Follow local immunization schedules and your clinician’s advice. This guide is general information only.
