## Overview
Liver cancer (most often **hepatocellular carcinoma**, HCC) usually develops after years of liver damage from chronic hepatitis B or C, alcohol-related liver disease, or metabolic disease that leads to cirrhosis. Preventing the underlying liver damage—and catching cancer early—are the biggest levers for better outcomes.

---

## Liver Cancer by the Numbers
- **4th leading cause** of cancer death worldwide (WHO, 2024).  
- **900,000 new cases** and **830,000 deaths** each year globally.  
- **>80%** of cases occur in regions with high hepatitis B or C prevalence (Asia, sub-Saharan Africa).  
- **Up to 90%** of hepatocellular carcinoma arises in patients with underlying cirrhosis.  
- **5-year survival:** ~18% overall, but **>50%** if detected early and treated with surgery or transplant.  

---

## Key Points
- **Chronic hepatitis B** is a major global cause of liver cancer; vaccination prevents many cases.  
- Risk rises sharply with **cirrhosis**, regardless of cause.  
- **Surveillance** (ultrasound ± AFP every 6 months) for at-risk people finds tumors earlier.  
- Early-stage tumors may be cured with **surgery, ablation, or transplant**.  
- Advanced disease is managed with **embolization** and **systemic therapies** (targeted agents, immunotherapy).  

---

## Symptoms & Signs
Many patients have no symptoms early on. Possible signs include:  
- Right upper abdominal pain or fullness  
- Unexplained weight loss or fatigue  
- Jaundice, dark urine, pale stools  
- Abdominal swelling (ascites)  

---

## Causes & Risk Factors
- Chronic **HBV** or **HCV** infection  
- **Cirrhosis** from any cause (alcohol, metabolic, viral)  
- Heavy alcohol use  
- Aflatoxin exposure (certain food contaminants)  
- Family history of liver cancer  
- Metabolic dysfunction (obesity, type 2 diabetes)  

---

## Diagnosis
- **Imaging:** Ultrasound, CT, or MRI to identify and stage lesions.  
- **Blood tests:** Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and liver function tests.  
- **Biopsy:** Sometimes needed when imaging is inconclusive.  

---

## Treatment Options
- **Surgery:** Resection for localized tumors with adequate liver reserve.  
- **Liver transplant:** For eligible patients within transplant criteria.  
- **Local therapies:** Ablation (radiofrequency, microwave) or transarterial embolization/chemoembolization (TACE).  
- **Systemic therapy:** Targeted agents and immunotherapy for advanced disease.  
- **Supportive care:** Symptom control, nutrition, and management of liver failure complications.  

Treatment depends on tumor stage, liver function (e.g., Child-Pugh), performance status, and transplant eligibility.

---

## Prevention & Surveillance
- **Vaccinate** against hepatitis B.  
- **Treat** chronic HBV/HCV to reduce progression to cirrhosis and cancer.  
- **Reduce alcohol** and manage metabolic risks (weight, diabetes).  
- **Surveil** high-risk groups every 6 months with ultrasound ± AFP.  

---

## Prognosis
Outcomes vary widely by stage at diagnosis and underlying liver function. Early detection via surveillance offers the best chance of curative treatment.

## FAQ
**Q: What causes most liver cancers?**  
A: Most primary liver cancers develop on a background of chronic hepatitis B or C and cirrhosis.  

**Q: How is it detected?**  
A: Imaging tests (ultrasound, CT, MRI) plus AFP blood tests; at-risk people should have 6-monthly surveillance.  

**Q: Is liver cancer curable?**  
A: Early-stage liver cancer can be cured with surgery, transplant, or ablation. Advanced stages are treated with embolization or systemic therapy.  

**Q: How can I reduce my risk?**  
A: Vaccinate against hepatitis B, treat HBV/HCV, avoid heavy alcohol, maintain healthy weight, and manage diabetes.
