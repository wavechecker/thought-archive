# Understanding Stroke Symptoms and FAST Response

A **stroke** happens when blood flow to the brain is interrupted or reduced, depriving brain tissue of oxygen and nutrients. **Every minute counts** — fast recognition and treatment can save lives and reduce long-term disability.  

---

## The FAST Acronym
Remember **FAST** to spot common stroke signs quickly:

- **F — Face**: drooping or numbness on one side  
- **A — Arms**: weakness, can’t raise both arms evenly  
- **S — Speech**: slurred, confused, or strange speech  
- **T — Time**: call **emergency services immediately**  

⚠️ Do not wait to see if symptoms improve. Some strokes are temporary (TIA, “mini-stroke”) but still signal urgent danger.

## Other Stroke Symptoms
Not all strokes look the same. Call emergency services if you notice:  
- Sudden **vision changes** (blurred, double, or loss of sight)  
- Sudden **confusion** or trouble understanding speech  
- Sudden **numbness or weakness** in the face, arm, or leg (especially on one side)  
- Sudden **loss of balance, dizziness, or coordination**  
- Sudden, severe **headache with no known cause**

## What Is a TIA (“Mini-Stroke”)?
A **Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)** is when stroke symptoms appear but resolve within minutes to hours.  
- TIAs are **not harmless** — they are a **major warning sign** of a future stroke.  
- About 1 in 3 people who experience a TIA will later have a stroke, often within days.  
- TIAs require **immediate medical assessment**, even if symptoms disappear.  

Think of a TIA as your body’s **“red alert”** — don’t ignore it.  

---

## What To Do While Waiting for Help
- Stay with the person, keep them calm and safe  
- Note the **time symptoms began** — doctors use this to decide treatment options  
- Do not give food, drink, or medicine unless instructed by emergency staff  

---

## Prevention
- **Control risk factors**: high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes  
- **Quit smoking**  
- **Exercise regularly** and maintain a healthy weight  
- **Eat a balanced diet** low in salt, sugar, and unhealthy fats  
- Take prescribed medicines (e.g., blood pressure tablets, anticoagulants) as directed

## Myth vs Fact

- **Myth:** Stroke only happens to the elderly.  
  **Fact:** Stroke can occur at any age, even in young adults and children.  

- **Myth:** If symptoms disappear, it’s nothing serious.  
  **Fact:** A TIA (“mini-stroke”) is a **serious warning sign** and must be checked urgently.  

- **Myth:** Stroke pain is always severe.  
  **Fact:** Many strokes cause **numbness or weakness**, not pain.  

- **Myth:** You can “sleep off” stroke symptoms.  
  **Fact:** Delaying care can mean permanent brain damage. Always call emergency services.
