## Intro
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a lifesaving technique used when someone’s heart or breathing has stopped. Immediate CPR can **double or triple survival chances** in cardiac arrest by keeping oxygen flowing to the brain until professional help arrives.

## Key Points
- **Check responsiveness and breathing** before starting CPR.  
- **Call emergency services** immediately.  
- Push **hard and fast** in the center of the chest (100–120 compressions per minute).  
- Use a defibrillator (AED) as soon as possible if one is available.  
- CPR steps differ slightly for adults, children, and infants.  

## When to Start CPR
- The person is **unresponsive**.  
- Not breathing normally (gasping is not normal breathing).  
- No pulse felt (if trained to check).  

If unsure, **start CPR** — doing something is safer than doing nothing.  

## Adult CPR (Age 8+)
1. Call emergency services and get an AED if available.  
2. Place the heel of one hand on the center of the chest, the other hand on top.  
3. Lock elbows, push down **5–6 cm (2–2.5 inches)** at 100–120 compressions per minute.  
   - Think “Stayin’ Alive” beat.  
4. After 30 compressions, give 2 rescue breaths if trained.  
   - If not trained or unwilling, continue chest compressions only.  
5. Keep going until help arrives or the person shows signs of life.  

## Child CPR (Age 1–8)
- Use **one hand** for compressions.  
- Compress **about 5 cm (2 inches)**.  
- Ratio: 30 compressions to 2 breaths (or 15:2 if two rescuers).  

## Infant CPR (Under 1 Year)
- Use **two fingers** on the center of the chest just below the nipple line.  
- Compress **about 4 cm (1.5 inches)**.  
- Ratio: 30 compressions to 2 gentle breaths.  

## Using an AED
- Turn it on and follow voice prompts.  
- Attach pads to the bare chest (adults and children).  
- For infants, use pediatric pads if available; if not, use standard pads with one on the chest and one on the back.  
- Deliver shock if advised, then resume CPR immediately.  

## Risks and Prognosis
- CPR may cause rib fractures or bruising, but this is less important than saving a life.  
- Survival depends on rapid response and defibrillation.  
- Early CPR + AED use dramatically improves outcomes.  

## FAQ
**Q: What if I’m not trained?**  
A: Do “hands-only CPR”: push hard and fast in the center of the chest until help arrives.  

**Q: Should I check for a pulse?**  
A: Only if you are trained. If unsure, start CPR.  

**Q: What if the person starts breathing again?**  
A: Stop CPR, place them in the recovery position, and monitor until help arrives.
