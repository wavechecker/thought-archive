# Atrial Fibrillation: Symptoms, Risks, and Treatment

**Atrial fibrillation (AF)** is an irregular and often rapid heart rhythm. It affects how efficiently the heart pumps blood and can increase the risk of **stroke, heart failure, and other complications**.

## Symptoms
- Palpitations (fluttering or racing heartbeat)  
- Shortness of breath  
- Fatigue or weakness  
- Dizziness or fainting in some cases  

## Risks
- **Blood clots and stroke** (due to irregular blood flow in the atria)  
- **Heart failure** if the heart cannot pump effectively  
- Increased risk of other heart rhythm problems  

## Treatment Options
- **Medications**  
  - *Rate control*: beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin  
  - *Rhythm control*: antiarrhythmic drugs (e.g., flecainide, amiodarone)  
- **Anticoagulants ("blood thinners")**  
  - Warfarin or newer oral anticoagulants (NOACs) to reduce stroke risk  
- **Procedures**  
  - *Electrical cardioversion* to restore normal rhythm  
  - *Catheter ablation* to isolate abnormal signals in the atria  
  - *Surgical options* in complex cases  

## Lifestyle and Monitoring
- Manage blood pressure, diabetes, and sleep apnea.  
- Limit alcohol and caffeine.  
- Regular follow-up with ECG or Holter monitoring.
