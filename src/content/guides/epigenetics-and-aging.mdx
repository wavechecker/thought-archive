## Intro

Epigenetics is often presented as the bridge between genes and environment. This guide will separate what is well-established from what is marketing.

## Key Points

- Epigenetics regulates gene expression without changing DNA sequence
- “Aging clocks” are biomarkers, not destiny
- Short-term clock changes don’t automatically mean long-term benefit

## FAQ

**Q: What is epigenetics?**  
A: Regulation of gene expression via chemical modifications (e.g., methylation) without changing DNA sequence.

**Q: What do epigenetic clocks measure?**  
A: DNA methylation patterns correlated with age and risk — informative, but not perfect.

**Q: Can you reverse epigenetic age?**  
A: Clock shifts are possible; outcome significance remains uncertain.
