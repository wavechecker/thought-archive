# What is Angina? Symptoms & Management

**Angina** is chest pain or discomfort caused by reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. It's a warning sign that your heart isn't getting enough oxygen — often linked to **coronary artery disease** (narrowing of the arteries that supply the heart).  

---

## Types of Angina
- **Stable Angina**  
  Predictable pain or pressure, often triggered by exercise, stress, or cold weather. Usually lasts a few minutes and improves with rest or nitroglycerin.  

- **Unstable Angina**  
  Sudden, worsening pain that may occur at rest, last longer, or be more severe than usual. This is a **medical emergency** as it can signal an impending heart attack.  

- **Variant (Prinzmetal's) Angina**  
  Caused by temporary spasm of the coronary arteries. Can occur at night or early morning, even without exertion.  

---

## Symptoms
- Pressure, tightness, heaviness, or burning in the chest  
- Pain spreading to the arm, neck, jaw, back, or stomach  
- Shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, or fatigue  
- Lasts **minutes, not seconds**  

⚠️ **Call emergency services** if chest pain is new, severe, or different from your usual pattern. Don't wait it out.

## Triggers
- Physical activity (climbing stairs, walking uphill)  
- Emotional stress  
- Heavy meals  
- Cold weather or sudden temperature changes  

---

## Management
- **Lifestyle changes**  
  - Stop smoking  
  - Eat a balanced, heart-healthy diet  
  - Exercise safely under medical guidance  
  - Manage stress  

- **Medication**  
  - **Nitrates** (e.g., nitroglycerin) to relieve attacks  
  - **Beta blockers** and **calcium channel blockers** to reduce heart workload  
  - **Antiplatelets** (aspirin, clopidogrel) to reduce clot risk  
  - **Statins** to lower cholesterol  

- **Procedures**  
  - **Angioplasty with stent** to open narrowed arteries  
  - **Bypass surgery** if multiple arteries are severely blocked  

---

## Prevention
- Regular check-ups for blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes  
- Take medicines exactly as prescribed  
- Carry nitroglycerin if recommended by your doctor  
- Know your personal **emergency action plan**
