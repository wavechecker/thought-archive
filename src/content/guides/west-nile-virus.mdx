# West Nile Virus (WNV)

## Overview
West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that cycles mainly between **birds and mosquitoes**. Humans and horses are **dead-end hosts**. Most infections cause **no symptoms**; some cause a **flu-like illness**; a small proportion develop **neuroinvasive disease**.

## How it spreads
- **Vectors:** Primarily *Culex* mosquitoes.  
- **Reservoirs:** Wild birds maintain the virus in nature.  
- **Seasonality:** Risk peaks in late summer and autumn.  
- **Ecology:** Warm, wet conditions (and sometimes drought clustering) amplify transmission.

## Recognize symptoms
- **Most people:** No symptoms.  
- **Mild illness:** Fever, headache, body/joint aches, fatigue, rash.  
- **Severe (neuroinvasive):** Severe headache, stiff neck, confusion, seizures, weakness or paralysis.  

> **Seek urgent care** for any neurological symptoms or rapidly worsening illness.

## Prevention
- **Repellents:** DEET, picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus.  
- **Clothing:** Long sleeves/pants; socks/shoes at dusk/dawn.  
- **Home:** Install/repair screens; use bed nets where appropriate.  
- **Environment:** Remove standing water (gutters, pots, birdbaths); cover rain barrels.

## Treatment
- **No specific antiviral.**  
- **Supportive care:** Rest, hydration, fever/pain control.  
- **Severe disease:** Hospital-level care for complications.
