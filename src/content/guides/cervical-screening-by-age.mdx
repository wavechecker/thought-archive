## Key Points

- Screening recommendations change with age
- Younger women clear HPV more easily
- Risk persists into later life
- Stopping too early increases cancer risk

## Typical Screening Timeline

- HPV infections are common and transient

### Ages 25–29
- HPV test every 5 years **or**
- Pap smear every 3 years

### Ages 30–49
- Primary HPV testing every 5 years
- Co-testing in some regions

### Ages 50–64
- Continued HPV screening
- Risk remains despite menopause

### Over 65
- Screening may stop **only if** prior tests were consistently normal
