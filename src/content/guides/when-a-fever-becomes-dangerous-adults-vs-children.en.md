# When a Fever Becomes Dangerous: Adults vs Children

## Overview
Fever is a natural response to infection and is often part of the body’s defense system. In most cases, it’s not dangerous. However, extremely high fevers or fevers accompanied by certain symptoms can signal a serious problem.

## Key Points
- Fever is generally defined as a body temperature of **38°C (100.4°F)** or higher.
- Most fevers are mild and self-limiting.
- Thresholds for concern are different for adults and children.
- Always look at the whole picture — symptoms matter more than the number alone.

## Fever in Adults
- Mild to moderate fever (up to 39°C / 102°F) is usually not harmful.
- Seek urgent care if fever:
  - Lasts more than 3 days.
  - Exceeds 39.4°C (103°F) without clear cause.
  - Is accompanied by chest pain, shortness of breath, severe headache, confusion, stiff neck, or rash.

## Fever in Children
- Newborns under 3 months: **Any fever above 38°C (100.4°F)** should be evaluated immediately.
- Children 3–6 months: Seek care if temperature reaches 38.3°C (101°F) or higher.
- Older children: Seek care if fever reaches 39°C (102°F) or higher and lasts more than a day, or if the child appears very unwell.

## Red Flag Symptoms (All Ages)
- Difficulty breathing
- Persistent vomiting
- Seizures
- Severe lethargy or unresponsiveness
- Rash that does not fade when pressed

## Home Care for Mild Fever
- Stay hydrated.
- Rest in a comfortable environment.
- Use light clothing and blankets.
- Fever-reducing medications (paracetamol/acetaminophen or ibuprofen) may help, but follow dosing instructions.

## FAQs

**Q: Is a fever always bad?**  
A: No — fever can be a sign that your immune system is fighting an infection.

**Q: Should I always treat a fever with medication?**  
A: Not necessarily — treat based on comfort and symptoms, not just the temperature.

**Q: Can teething cause fever in babies?**  
A: Mild temperature rises are possible, but true fever is usually due to infection.
