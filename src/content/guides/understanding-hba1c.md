## Intro
**HbA1c** (also called **A1C**) reflects your **average blood glucose over ~3 months** by measuring how much glucose is attached to haemoglobin in red blood cells. It’s used to **diagnose diabetes and prediabetes** and to **track long-term control**. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Key Points
- HbA1c is an **average of the last ~8–12 weeks**, not a spot glucose reading. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- **Diagnosis (ADA/WHO):** diabetes at **≥6.5% (48 mmol/mol)**; prediabetes **5.7–6.4%** (ADA). Use standardised assays. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- **Typical target for many adults with diabetes:** **<7%** (individualise). :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- Pair HbA1c with **CGM Time-in-Range (TIR)** for day-to-day quality and safety. Aim **≥70% TIR (70–180 mg/dL / 3.9–10.0 mmol/L)**, with **<4%** below 70 mg/dL. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- HbA1c can be **misleading** with anaemia, haemoglobin variants, kidney disease, pregnancy, recent transfusion, or rapid RBC turnover. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

## What exactly does HbA1c measure?
Glucose slowly binds to haemoglobin inside red blood cells. Because RBCs live ~3 months, the percentage that is glycated (HbA1c) tracks your **mean exposure to glucose** over that period. Higher average glucose → higher HbA1c. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

---

## Using HbA1c for Diagnosis
- **Diabetes:** **A1C ≥6.5% (48 mmol/mol)**, confirmed (or with classic symptoms and random glucose).  
- **Prediabetes (ADA):** **A1C 5.7–6.4% (39–46 mmol/mol)**.  
Use a lab method aligned to IFCC/NGSP standards; when results conflict with glucose tests or clinical picture, **repeat/confirm** with another test. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

---

## Targets & Testing Frequency
- **Targets (individualise):** Many non-pregnant adults aim for **A1C <7%**; tighter or looser goals depend on age, comorbidity, and hypoglycaemia risk. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- **How often to test:**  
  - **Every 6 months** if stable and at goal.  
  - **Every 3 months** if therapy changed or goals not met. (Per ADA Standards.) :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

## HbA1c ↔ Estimated Average Glucose (eAG)
The **ADAG** formula converts A1C to an estimated average glucose:

- **eAG (mg/dL) = 28.7 × A1C − 46.7**  
- **eAG (mmol/L) = (28.7 × A1C − 46.7) ÷ 18** :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

| HbA1c (%) | eAG (mg/dL) | eAG (mmol/L) |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 5 | 97 | 5.4 |
| 6 | 125 | 7.0 |
| 7 | 154 | 8.6 |
| 8 | 183 | 10.2 |
| 9 | 212 | 11.8 |
| 10 | 240 | 13.4 |
| 11 | 269 | 14.9 |
| 12 | 298 | 16.5 |

> eAG is an **estimate**. Day-to-day swings, hypoglycaemia exposure, and overnight control may not be obvious from HbA1c alone.

## HbA1c + Time-in-Range (TIR): Better Together
HbA1c shows the **average**, while TIR (from CGM) shows **how often you’re in the target band** and how much time is spent low or high.  
- General adult targets: **TIR ≥70% (70–180 mg/dL / 3.9–10.0 mmol/L)**; **TBR <4%** (<70 mg/dL) and **<1%** (<54 mg/dL). Individualise for frailty/pregnancy. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

---

## When HbA1c Can Mislead
Consider alternatives (e.g., **fructosamine/glycated albumin**) or rely more on CGM metrics when any of the below apply:  
- **Anaemia (iron deficiency can raise; haemolysis can lower)**, recent **transfusion**, **erythropoietin**, **dialysis**, **CKD**.  
- **Haemoglobin variants** (e.g., HbS, HbC) — some assays are affected.  
- **Pregnancy** (altered RBC lifespan; not used to diagnose gestational diabetes). :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}

## FAQ
**Is HbA1c the same as my “average” on CGM?**  
They usually correlate, but CGM averages and HbA1c can **diverge** due to sensor use time, day-night variability, anaemia, or RBC lifespan. Use **both** HbA1c and TIR. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}

**My HbA1c looks “too good” for my meter readings — why?**  
Check for factors that **lower HbA1c artificially** (e.g., haemolysis, recent blood loss/transfusion). :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}

**What should my A1C target be?**  
Many adults aim **<7%**; older adults or those at high hypoglycaemia risk may use a **less stringent** goal. Discuss with your clinician. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}
