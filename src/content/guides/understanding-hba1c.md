# Sick-Day Management for Type 1 Diabetes

Being unwell with Type 1 diabetes raises your risk of high blood glucose and **diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)**. Following a clear sick-day plan helps you stay safe.

---

## Core Rules
- **Never stop basal insulin** — even if you're not eating.  
- **Check blood glucose more often** (every 2–4 hours, or as advised by your team).  
- **Check ketones** if BGL is high or if you feel unwell.  

---

## Fluids & Carbs
- Take **small, frequent sips** of sugar-free fluids to stay hydrated.  
- If you can't eat normally, use **sick-day carb options** (juices, glucose drinks, oral rehydration solutions) to prevent ketosis.  

---

## Insulin Adjustments
- Follow your written sick-day plan for **corrections** and **temporary basal changes** (if on a pump).  
- Contact your diabetes team early if BGL stays high or ketones are rising.  

---

## Red Flags — Seek Urgent Care
- **Ketones ≥ 3.0 mmol/L**  
- Rising ketones despite extra insulin  
- Vomiting, abdominal pain, or drowsiness  
- Rapid or deep breathing (possible DKA)  

⚠️ Don't wait — go to emergency services if these appear.
