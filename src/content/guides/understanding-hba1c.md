# Understanding HbA1c and Why It Matters

HbA1c gives a 2–3 month average of blood glucose control. It’s a key marker for long-term outcomes in diabetes.

## Key points
- Target varies by age and circumstance (often <7%).  
- High HbA1c = increased risk of complications.  
- Lowering HbA1c safely reduces risks, but avoid frequent hypos.
