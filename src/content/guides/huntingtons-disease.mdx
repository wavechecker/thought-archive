## Intro
Huntington’s disease (HD) is a rare, inherited condition that causes progressive damage to the brain. It affects movement, thinking, and emotions, leading to increasing disability over time.  

## Key Points
- Caused by a **genetic mutation** in the huntingtin (HTT) gene.  
- Symptoms usually begin between ages **35–55**, though earlier and later onset occur.  
- Progression continues for **10–25 years** after onset.  
- No cure exists, but medications and therapies can help manage symptoms.  
- Experimental **gene therapy** offers new hope.  

## Background
Huntington’s disease is an **autosomal dominant** disorder — meaning that inheriting one copy of the faulty gene is enough to cause the disease. Each child of an affected parent has a **50% chance** of inheriting the mutation.  

## Causes or Mechanisms
- The HTT gene contains a **CAG trinucleotide repeat**.  
- Healthy people have fewer than ~36 repeats.  
- People with HD have 36+ repeats, and the longer the repeat stretch, the earlier and more severe the disease.  
- The faulty gene produces a **toxic huntingtin protein** that damages neurons, especially in the striatum and cortex.  

## Symptoms
- **Motor**: involuntary movements (chorea), impaired balance, clumsiness.  
- **Cognitive**: poor concentration, memory decline, impaired judgment.  
- **Psychiatric**: depression, irritability, mood swings.  

## Diagnosis / Treatment
- **Diagnosis**: based on symptoms, family history, genetic testing, and brain imaging.  
- **Treatment options**:  
  - Medications for movement (e.g., tetrabenazine) and mood disorders.  
  - Physical and occupational therapy.  
  - Counseling and psychiatric support.  
  - Gene therapy (experimental, see [Gene Therapy for Huntington’s Disease](/guides/huntingtons-disease-gene-therapy)).  

## Prognosis
Huntington’s disease is progressive and ultimately fatal, usually within **10–25 years** of symptom onset. Treatments can improve quality of life, and research is advancing rapidly toward disease-modifying options.  

## FAQ
**Q: Can Huntington’s disease skip a generation?**  
A: No. Because it is autosomal dominant, if the gene is not inherited, the disease cannot appear later in that family line.  

**Q: How common is it?**  
A: It affects around **3–10 people per 100,000** in Western populations.  

**Q: Are there lifestyle changes that help?**  
A: Exercise, physical therapy, and supportive care can help maintain independence longer.
