# Blood Glucose Testing — How and When to Check

## Why this matters
Frequent, accurate checks help you match insulin to food/activity, spot highs or lows early, and prevent complications. Even with a CGM, finger-stick checks are sometimes needed.

## When to check (general)
- **Before meals** and **at bedtime**  
- **Before driving**, exercise, and during/after prolonged activity  
- **Overnight** if you’ve had a hypo, exercised late, or feel unwell  
- **Any time you feel “off”** (shaky, sweaty, thirsty, extra tired)  
- **During illness** and **if BGL is high** (often ≥15 mmol/L), check **ketones** too

> Follow your **personal diabetes plan** for exact targets and frequency.

## Using a finger-stick meter — accurate technique
1. **Wash and dry hands** (no food residue).  
2. Use a **new lancet**; prick the **side** of the fingertip.  
3. Wipe away the **first drop** if needed; use the **second** for a clean sample.  
4. Apply enough blood to the strip; avoid squeezing excessively.  
5. **Record** the result and note context (meal, activity, illness).

## Using a CGM (if you have one)
- Calibrate only if your model requires it (follow device instructions).  
- Use **alarms** for highs/lows; **confirm with finger-stick** if symptoms don’t match the CGM or when **ketones are present**.  
- Trend arrows help predict where glucose is heading (useful for exercise/bedtime).

## Common mistakes to avoid
- Testing with **sticky/dirty hands** → false highs  
- **Old strips** or strips not stored dry/cool  
- Relying on CGM values **when dehydrated/ketotic** without a confirmatory finger-stick  
- Not rechecking after treating a **hypo** (see “Emergency Actions” guide)

## When to seek help
- Frequent unexplained **lows** or **highs**  
- **Sick days** with persistent high BGL or ketones  
- **New or worsening symptoms** that don’t fit your usual pattern
