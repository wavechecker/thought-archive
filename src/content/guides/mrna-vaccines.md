# mRNA Vaccines


## Intro
What mRNA vaccines are + why they matter.


## Key Points
- Mechanism: transient mRNA → antigen → immune response.
- Manufacturing speed & adaptability.
- Safety profile from trials + post‑marketing.


## Background
Discovery; lipid nanoparticles; COVID‑19 acceleration; approvals.


## Mechanisms
Innate/adaptive pathways; dosing; boosters.


## Evidence
Efficacy data; real‑world effectiveness; safety monitoring.


## Risks / Benefits
Known adverse events; risk comparison vs. disease risk.


## FAQ
**Q: Do mRNA vaccines alter DNA?**
A: No; they do not enter the nucleus or integrate into the genome.


## Further Reading
- FDA/EMA overviews; PubMed reviews
