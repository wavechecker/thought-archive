# mRNA Vaccines

## Intro
mRNA vaccines represent a new class of vaccines that use messenger RNA to instruct the body’s own cells to produce an antigen, which then triggers an immune response. They were deployed globally during the COVID-19 pandemic and are now being developed for influenza, RSV, and even cancer.

## Key Points
- **Mechanism:** mRNA inside lipid nanoparticles delivers instructions to cells to make a harmless piece of the target pathogen (e.g., coronavirus spike protein).  
- **Speed:** Can be designed and manufactured much faster than traditional vaccines.  
- **Efficacy:** COVID-19 mRNA vaccines showed high effectiveness against severe disease and death.  
- **Safety:** Large clinical trials and global surveillance confirm safety, though rare side effects (e.g., myocarditis) have been identified.  
- **Future:** Research underway for flu, RSV, HIV, and therapeutic cancer vaccines.  

## Background
- **Origins:** The concept of mRNA therapy dates back to the 1990s but faced stability and delivery challenges.  
- **Breakthrough:** Use of lipid nanoparticles and modified nucleosides solved key problems of degradation and immune overactivation.  
- **COVID-19:** Pfizer–BioNTech and Moderna’s vaccines were the first mRNA vaccines authorized for widespread human use in late 2020.  

## Mechanisms
- **How it works:**  
  1. Lipid nanoparticle carries synthetic mRNA into human cells.  
  2. Cells use ribosomes to translate mRNA into protein (antigen).  
  3. Immune system recognizes the antigen and builds memory responses.  
- **Key point:** mRNA never enters the cell’s nucleus and cannot alter DNA. It is degraded naturally after use.  

## Evidence
- **Efficacy:** Clinical trials showed ~95% efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 initially, with strong protection against severe outcomes.  
- **Real-world data:** Effectiveness wanes over time, leading to booster recommendations. Still, mRNA vaccines consistently reduce hospitalization and death.  
- **Safety:**  
  - Common side effects: injection-site pain, fatigue, headache, fever.  
  - Rare risks: myocarditis (mostly young males), pericarditis, very rare anaphylaxis.  
  - Extensive monitoring (VAERS, VSD, EudraVigilance, AusVaxSafety) supports a favorable safety profile.  

## Risks / Benefits
- **Benefits:** Rapidly scalable, adaptable to variants, strong immune response including neutralizing antibodies and T-cell activation.  
- **Risks:** Requires cold-chain storage (−20°C to −70°C for early versions), reactogenic side effects, rare myocarditis cases.  
- **Balance:** Benefits in preventing severe disease and death far outweigh risks.  

## Global Recommendations
- **WHO:** Recommends mRNA vaccines as part of COVID-19 vaccination schedules.  
- **CDC (US):** Endorses mRNA vaccines as the preferred platform for COVID-19 vaccination.  
- **ATAGI (Australia):** Strongly recommends mRNA vaccines for eligible age groups, with specific guidance on myocarditis risk in young males.  

## Future Directions
- Seasonal influenza vaccines (currently in trials).  
- RSV vaccines (several candidates in late-stage trials).  
- Therapeutic cancer vaccines targeting tumor antigens.  
- Potential applications in personalized medicine.  

## FAQ
**Q: Can mRNA vaccines change my DNA?**  
A: No. mRNA never enters the nucleus of the cell and is broken down naturally after protein translation.  

**Q: Why do I need boosters?**  
A: Immunity wanes over time, and new variants may partially escape prior immunity. Boosters restore protection.  

**Q: Are mRNA vaccines safe in pregnancy?**  
A: Yes. Evidence shows safety in pregnant individuals and protection of newborns through maternal antibodies.  

**Q: Will mRNA vaccines replace all other types?**  
A: Not entirely. While promising, mRNA vaccines may not be ideal for every disease; other platforms remain important.
