## Intro
As GLP-1 use expands beyond obesity and diabetes, risk–benefit calculations shift. This guide examines use in **non-obese, metabolically healthy adults**, where evidence is thinner and uncertainty is higher.

## Key Points
- Most GLP-1 trials excluded non-obese individuals
- Absolute benefit decreases as baseline risk falls
- Muscle loss and frailty risks may increase with age
- Long-term safety data is limited

<StratBox title="Grey-Zone Use Warning" level="uncertain">
GLP-1 use in **non-obese, metabolically healthy** adults is a grey zone:

- Many prescriptions here are **off-label** or based on limited evidence.
- If baseline metabolic risk is low, **side effects and long-term uncertainty** matter more.
- Consider focusing first on: sleep, nutrition quality, resistance training, and addressing medication/medical drivers of weight change.

If you’re using a GLP-1 primarily for cosmetic weight loss, talk to a clinician about:
dose, exit strategy, muscle preservation, monitoring, and what “success” looks like beyond the scale.
