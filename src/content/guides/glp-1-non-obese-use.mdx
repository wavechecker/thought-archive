## Intro
As GLP-1 use expands beyond obesity and diabetes, risk–benefit calculations shift. This guide examines use in **non-obese, metabolically healthy adults**.

## Key Points
- Most GLP-1 trials excluded non-obese individuals  
- Absolute benefit decreases as baseline risk falls  
- Muscle loss and frailty risks may increase with age  
- Long-term safety data is limited  

<StratBox title="Grey-Zone Use Warning" level="uncertain">
GLP-1 use in metabolically healthy, non-obese adults falls outside populations studied in most clinical trials. Long-term safety and benefit remain uncertain.
</StratBox>

## Trial Populations
Most outcome data comes from individuals with:
- Type 2 diabetes  
- BMI ≥30 (or ≥27 with comorbidities)  

## Risk Inflation in Low-Risk Groups
When baseline disease risk is low:
- Side effects carry greater relative weight  
- Tolerance for uncertainty narrows  
- Long-term unknowns become more significant

  evidence="Non-obese, metabolically healthy individuals are underrepresented in GLP-1 trials. Long-term safety data is limited."

## Muscle and Aging Considerations
Chronic appetite suppression may accelerate sarcopenia and increase frailty risk in aging populations.

## Ethical and Clinical Considerations
Questions include:
- Preventive medicine vs enhancement  
- Informed consent around long-term uncertainty  
- Management of discontinuation and rebound weight gain  

## FAQ
**Q: Should healthy people use GLP-1 drugs?**  
A: Evidence is limited; caution and individualized risk assessment are advised.
