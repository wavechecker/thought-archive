## Intro
As GLP-1 use expands beyond obesity and diabetes, risk–benefit calculations shift. This guide examines use in **non-obese, metabolically healthy adults**, where evidence is thinner and uncertainty is higher.

## Key Points
- Most GLP-1 trials excluded non-obese individuals
- Absolute benefit decreases as baseline risk falls
- Muscle loss and frailty risks may increase with age
- Long-term safety data is limited

<StratBox title="Grey-Zone Use Warning" level="uncertain">
GLP-1 use in metabolically healthy, non-obese adults falls outside populations studied in most clinical trials. Long-term safety and benefit remain uncertain.
</StratBox>

## Trial Populations
Most GLP-1 outcome data comes from studies involving people with:
- Type 2 diabetes
- BMI ≥30 (or ≥27 with weight-related comorbidities)

That means evidence does not generalize cleanly to metabolically healthy, non-obese groups.

## Risk Inflation in Low-Risk Groups
When baseline disease risk is low:
- Side effects carry greater relative weight
- Tolerance for uncertainty narrows
- Long-term unknowns become more significant

## Evidence Summary
**Source:** Trial inclusion criteria + generalizability limits  
**Last updated:** 2026-01-14

- Most GLP-1 trials focus on obesity and/or type 2 diabetes; non-obese, metabolically healthy adults are underrepresented.
- When baseline risk is low, the absolute benefit decreases while side effects and unknowns become relatively more important.
- Long-term safety and net benefit are least certain in this grey-zone population.

## Muscle and Aging Considerations
Chronic appetite suppression may contribute to lower protein intake and reduced resistance exercise. Over time, this may increase the risk of sarcopenia and frailty—particularly in older adults or those with already-low muscle mass.

## Ethical and Clinical Considerations
Common questions include:
- Preventive medicine vs enhancement
- Informed consent around long-term uncertainty
- Managing discontinuation and rebound weight gain
- Equity and access when supply is constrained

## FAQ
**Q: Are GLP-1 drugs approved for non-obese individuals?**  
A: Approval typically targets obesity or diabetes. Evidence for use in non-obese, metabolically healthy people is limited.

**Q: Do risks increase when GLP-1 drugs are used for cosmetic weight loss?**  
A: When baseline metabolic risk is low, side effects and long-term uncertainty become relatively more important.
