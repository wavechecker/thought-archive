# BGL & Ketones — Quick Reference Chart

Keep this as a simple reminder of when things are OK — and when to act fast.  

## Blood Glucose (BGL)

| Range | What it Means | What to Do |
|-------|---------------|------------|
| 4–7 mmol/L | Ideal before meals | ✅ Safe |
| < 4 mmol/L | Hypo (low) | 🚨 Treat with fast carbs |
| 7–10 mmol/L | Acceptable after meals | Monitor |
| > 14 mmol/L | High | 🚨 Check ketones, consider correction insulin |

---

## Ketones

| Level | What it Means | What to Do |
|-------|---------------|------------|
| < 0.6 mmol/L | Normal | ✅ Safe |
| 0.6–1.4 mmol/L | Mild rise | Recheck, hydrate, correction insulin |
| 1.5–2.9 mmol/L | Moderate | Sick-day rules, increase monitoring |
| ≥ 3.0 mmol/L | High DKA risk | 🚨 Seek urgent medical help |

⚠️ **Red Flags** — get urgent help if:
- Ketones ≥ 3.0 mmol/L  
- Vomiting or unable to keep fluids down  
- Abdominal pain, rapid breathing, drowsiness  
- BGL > 14 mmol/L and not coming down with correction
