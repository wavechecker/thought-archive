## Intro
Skin cancer is highly treatable when caught early, but prevention and vigilance are critical. Knowing what to look for — and how to protect yourself — can save lives.

## Key Points
- Most skin cancers are linked to UV exposure.  
- Warning signs include **new, changing, or non-healing spots**.  
- The **ABCDE rule** helps identify suspicious moles.  
- Prevention relies on sunscreen, protective clothing, and skin checks.  
- Nicotinamide (vitamin B3) may offer additional protection for high-risk people.  

## Warning Signs
- **New or changing mole** — especially if irregular in shape or color.  
- **Sores that don’t heal** — persistent ulcers or bleeding spots.  
- **Scaly or rough patches** — may indicate SCC.  
- **Shiny or pearly bumps** — typical of BCC.  
- **ABCDE rule for melanoma**:  
  - **A**symmetry  
  - **B**order irregularity  
  - **C**olor variation  
  - **D**iameter >6mm  
  - **E**volving over time  

## Prevention
- **Sunscreen:** Apply SPF 30+ daily, reapply every 2 hours outdoors.  
- **Clothing:** Hats, long sleeves, sunglasses.  
- **Avoid tanning beds:** Artificial UV is just as harmful as sunlight.  
- **Shade:** Especially between 10am–4pm when UV is strongest.  
- **Self-checks:** Monthly skin checks and yearly dermatology exams if high-risk.  

## Nicotinamide and Prevention
Recent large-scale research suggests **nicotinamide (vitamin B3)** may reduce skin cancer risk, especially for squamous cell carcinoma. It may be considered for people with a history of skin cancer, but it’s not a replacement for sun protection.  

## FAQ
**Q: What are the first signs of skin cancer?**  
A: New or changing moles, sores that don’t heal, scaly patches, or shiny bumps.  

**Q: What is the ABCDE rule for melanoma?**  
A: Asymmetry, Border irregularity, Color variation, Diameter larger than 6mm, and Evolving over time.  

**Q: How can I lower my risk of skin cancer?**  
A: Daily sunscreen, protective clothing, avoiding tanning beds, and skin checks.  

**Q: Does vitamin B3 help prevent skin cancer?**  
A: Research suggests nicotinamide may reduce risk, but it’s not a substitute for sun protection.
