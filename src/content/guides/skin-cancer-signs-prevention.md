# Skin Cancer — Warning Signs and Prevention

Skin cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide, but early detection greatly improves outcomes.

**Summary**  
Know the signs, check your skin regularly, and protect yourself from UV exposure.

## Types of Skin Cancer

- **Basal cell carcinoma** — slow-growing, rarely spreads  
- **Squamous cell carcinoma** — can spread if untreated  
- **Melanoma** — most dangerous, can spread rapidly

## Warning Signs (ABCDE for moles)

- **A**symmetry — uneven halves  
- **B**order — irregular edges  
- **C**olour — multiple colours or uneven tone  
- **D**iameter — larger than 6mm  
- **E**volving — changes in size, shape, or colour

## Prevention

- Use SPF 30+ sunscreen daily  
- Wear hats and protective clothing  
- Avoid tanning beds  
- Seek shade during midday sun

## FAQs

**Q: Do darker skin tones get skin cancer?**  
A: Yes — though risk is lower, late detection is common.

**Q: How often should I check my skin?**  
A: Monthly self-checks, yearly professional skin exams.

**Q: Is every mole a risk?**  
A: No — most moles are harmless. The key is noticing changes: new moles, or existing ones that change in shape, colour, or size. Use the ABCDE rule as a guide.

**Q: When should I see a doctor?**  
A: Any time you notice a suspicious spot, sore that won’t heal, or a mole that changes. Early assessment by a GP or dermatologist can make all the difference.

**Q: Can sunscreen really prevent skin cancer?**  
A: Yes — regular use of SPF 30+ sunscreen significantly lowers the risk of all major types of skin cancer, including melanoma.
