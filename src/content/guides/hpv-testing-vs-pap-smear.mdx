## Intro

Cervical screening saves lives, but confusion around **Pap smears** and **HPV tests** causes many women to delay or avoid screening altogether.

They are related—but not the same.

---

## Key Differences at a Glance

- Pap smear → looks for **abnormal cervical cells**
- HPV test → looks for **high-risk HPV DNA**
- HPV testing finds risk **earlier**
- Pap smears detect **existing damage**

---

## Pap Smear (Cytology)

A Pap smear examines cervical cells under a microscope.

**Strength:**  
- Detects precancerous cell changes directly

**Limitations:**  
- Can miss early HPV infection  
- Lower sensitivity than HPV testing

---

## HPV Testing

HPV testing detects genetic material from cancer-causing HPV strains.

**Strength:**  
- Identifies risk before cell damage occurs  
- Higher sensitivity for cancer prevention

**Limitations:**  
- Does not show cell changes on its own

---

## Why Guidelines Are Changing

Because persistent HPV infection causes nearly all cervical cancers, detecting the virus earlier improves prevention. Many programs now use:

- Primary HPV testing  
- Pap smear only if HPV is detected
