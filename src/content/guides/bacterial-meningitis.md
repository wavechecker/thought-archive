faq:
  - q: Why is bacterial meningitis an emergency?
    a: >-
      It can cause death or severe disability within hours; immediate
      antibiotics and hospital care are essential.
  - q: What are the warning signs?
    a: >-
      Fever, headache, stiff neck, light sensitivity, confusion, vomiting, and
      sometimes a purplish rash (meningococcal).
  - q: How is it treated?
    a: >-
      IV antibiotics, steroids, and supportive care in hospital; close contacts
      may need preventive antibiotics (prophylaxis).
  - q: Can it be prevented?
    a: >-
      Yes — vaccines protect against common causes (meningococcal, pneumococcal,
      Hib). Early treatment of infections also lowers risk.

## Intro
Bacterial meningitis is an infection of the **meninges** (membranes covering the brain and spinal cord). It progresses rapidly and can be fatal if not treated immediately.

## Key Points
- **Emergency condition**: needs **immediate antibiotics** and hospital care.  
- Symptoms: **fever, stiff neck, headache, confusion, rash**.  
- Spread through **respiratory droplets and close contact**.  
- Complications: septicemia, hearing loss, brain damage, death.  
- Prevention: **vaccination** and prophylaxis for close contacts.

## Background
Viruses also cause meningitis, but bacterial forms are more severe. Common bacteria: *Neisseria meningitidis*, *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, *Haemophilus influenzae*.

## Causes or Mechanisms
Bacteria invade meninges via bloodstream or direct spread (e.g., sinus/ear infections, trauma). Inflammation increases intracranial pressure and damages tissues.

## Diagnosis / Treatment / Options
**Diagnosis:** urgent lumbar puncture with CSF analysis, blood cultures; imaging if indicated.  
**Treatment:** IV broad-spectrum antibiotics immediately; steroids (e.g., dexamethasone); ICU support as needed. Prophylaxis for close contacts (rifampin, ciprofloxacin, or ceftriaxone for meningococcal cases).  

## Risks / Benefits / Prognosis
Mortality up to 10–15% despite treatment; survivors may have long-term effects (hearing loss, cognitive impairment). Early care improves outcomes.

## FAQ
**Q: Who should be vaccinated?**  
A: Children, adolescents, and high-risk adults — check local immunization schedules for meningococcal, pneumococcal, and Hib vaccines.
