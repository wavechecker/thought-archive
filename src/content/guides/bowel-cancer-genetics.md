# Family Risk and Genetics in Bowel Cancer

Most bowel cancers are **sporadic** (happen by chance), but about **1 in 10 cases are linked to inherited genetic factors**. Knowing your family risk helps decide whether you should start screening earlier, or consider genetic testing.

---

## Family History
Your risk is higher if:  
- A **first-degree relative** (parent, sibling, or child) had bowel cancer.  
- Multiple relatives on the same side of the family were affected.  
- A relative was diagnosed at a **younger age** (before 50).  

The closer the relation and the younger the age of diagnosis, the stronger the risk.

---

## Genetic Conditions
Some rare inherited syndromes carry a very high risk:  

- **Lynch Syndrome (HNPCC)**: Increases lifetime risk of bowel and other cancers.  
- **Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP)**: Causes hundreds of polyps in the bowel, almost always progressing to cancer without treatment.  
- **MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP)**: Similar to FAP but usually fewer polyps.  

---

## Genetic Testing
- Recommended if your family history suggests an inherited syndrome.  
- Usually involves a **blood test** or cheek swab to check for specific gene mutations.  
- Results help guide personalised screening and prevention plans for you and your relatives.  

---

## What This Means for Screening
- **Average risk**: Begin screening at 50 (FIT test, colonoscopy if needed).  
- **Moderate risk**: Screening may start at 40, or 10 years earlier than the youngest family diagnosis.  
- **High risk (Lynch, FAP, MAP)**: Screening may begin in the 20s or 30s, with regular colonoscopy.

## Takeaway
Family history and genetics don't guarantee you'll develop bowel cancer, but they change your risk level and influence screening recommendations. If you're concerned, talk to your doctor or a genetic counsellor — early awareness saves lives.
