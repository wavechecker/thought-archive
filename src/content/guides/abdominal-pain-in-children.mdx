## Intro

Abdominal pain is one of the most common — and most anxiety-provoking — symptoms in children.

Most cases are benign (constipation, viral illness, functional pain). A smaller number are **time-sensitive** (appendicitis, torsion, obstruction). The difference is usually **pattern, progression, and behaviour**, not how dramatic the pain sounds.

---

## Key Principles (How clinicians think about this)

- **Progression beats severity:** pain that steadily worsens is more concerning than pain that sounds severe but improves.
- **Movement matters:** pain with walking, jumping, or coughing suggests peritoneal irritation.
- **Localisation matters:** pain that becomes focused in one spot is more concerning than diffuse pain.
- **Behaviour is a vital sign:** a very still, withdrawn child is more concerning than a distractible one.
- **Constipation is common and underestimated**, even when a child still passes stool.

---

## Traffic-Light Triage

### 🟢 GREEN — Monitor at home (with safety-net)

Typical pattern:
- Child is **alert, interactive, distractible**
- Pain is **not steadily worsening** and **not localising**
- Vomiting is absent or mild and fluids are tolerated
- Normal urine output

What to do:
- Encourage fluids
- Light diet as tolerated
- Rest
- Reassess every **2–4 hours**
- Escalate if the pattern changes

---

### 🟠 AMBER — Same-day medical review

Arrange same-day review if:
- Pain persists **>6–12 hours** without improvement
- Recurrent episodes affect school or sleep
- Vomiting or fever accompanies pain
- Emerging localisation (especially right-sided)
- Urinary symptoms or “something feels off”

---

### 🔴 RED — Urgent assessment now

Seek urgent care if any are present:
- Worsening, localised pain (especially right lower abdomen)
- Pain with walking/jumping/coughing or child lies very still
- Persistent vomiting or inability to keep fluids down
- **Bilious (green) vomiting**
- Blood in vomit or stool with significant pain
- Marked lethargy or dehydration
- Abdominal swelling or rigidity
- **Sudden testicular pain** or severe pelvic pain

## Common Causes by Pattern

### Usually low-risk
- Constipation  
- Viral illness / gastroenteritis  
- Gas or indigestion  
- Functional (anxiety-related) abdominal pain  

### Needs clinician review
- Urinary tract infection  
- Strep throat (can present as belly pain)  
- Food intolerance  
- Reflux  

### Time-sensitive “don’t miss”
- **Appendicitis**
- **Testicular torsion**
- Intussusception (younger children)
- Ovarian torsion (adolescents)
- Diabetic ketoacidosis (thirst, frequent urination, vomiting)
- Pneumonia (referred abdominal pain)

---

## What to Expect if You Seek Care

Assessment often includes:
- Vital signs and hydration check
- Abdominal exam (sometimes repeated)
- Urine testing
- Blood tests if indicated
- Ultrasound if appendicitis or torsion suspected
- Clear safety-net instructions if discharged

*A normal early test does not always exclude appendicitis — reassessment matters.*
