  - q: "When is tummy pain in a child an emergency?"
    a: "Seek urgent care if your child looks very unwell, has severe worsening pain, green vomiting, blood in stool, a rigid abdomen, or signs of dehydration."
  - q: "How can I tell constipation from something more serious?"
    a: "Constipation often causes crampy pain and relief after passing stool. Red flags include persistent worsening pain, fever, or a child who looks unwell."
  - q: "Can anxiety cause abdominal pain in children?"
    a: "Yes — functional abdominal pain is common, especially in school-aged children. It often follows patterns like morning or school-day timing."
  - q: "What should I do at home first?"
    a: "If there are no red flags, focus on fluids, rest, gentle foods, and monitoring. Re-check frequently for worsening symptoms."
  - q: "My child says pain is 10 out of 10 — is that automatically an emergency?"
    a: "Not always. What matters most is how the pain is progressing, whether your child looks very unwell, and if there are associated red-flag symptoms."

## Intro

Abdominal pain is one of the most common reasons children feel unwell — and one of the hardest symptoms for parents to interpret.

Most cases settle on their own (constipation, a viral bug, gas, or stress-related pain). A smaller number need urgent medical assessment. The key difference is usually **how your child looks and behaves**, **how the pain is changing**, and **what symptoms come with it** — not pain intensity alone.

If you’re unsure and your child seems “not themselves,” trust that instinct and seek advice.

## Key Points

- **Most tummy pain in children is not dangerous**, especially if your child is playing, drinking, and improving.
- **Urgent assessment is needed** when pain is rapidly worsening, your child looks very unwell, or there are red flags (below).
- **Constipation is a top cause** — even when a child is still passing some stool.
- **Appendicitis matters** because it often starts vaguely, then becomes more localised and progressive.
- If symptoms persist beyond **24–48 hours**, recur frequently, or disrupt sleep/school, organise a review.

## Traffic Light Triage

### Red: seek urgent care now

Go to urgent care / emergency (or call local urgent services) if your child has **any** of the following:

- **Looks very unwell**: very drowsy, floppy, confused, or hard to wake
- **Severe, worsening pain**, especially pain that escalates over hours
- **Green vomiting** (bilious) or repeated vomiting that won’t settle
- **Blood** in vomit, black/tarry stool, or significant blood in stool
- **Rigid belly**, severe tenderness, or pain with even light movement
- **Pain that worsens with walking, jumping, or bumps** (classic “peritonism” concern)
- **Testicular pain** (in boys) with abdominal pain
- **Dehydration signs**: very dry mouth, no tears, minimal urine, sunken eyes, lethargy

### Amber: same-day review

Seek a same-day GP/urgent clinic review if:

- Pain lasts **more than 24 hours** without clear improvement
- Pain **wakes your child** from sleep
- Fever + abdominal pain (especially persistent or rising fever)
- Ongoing diarrhoea or vomiting (even if not severe)
- Urinary symptoms (pain with urination, frequent urination) or flank/back pain
- Your child is refusing fluids, eating very little, or seems significantly reduced in activity
- Recurrent pain that is increasing in frequency or severity

### Green: watch and wait (with active monitoring)

Home care and observation is reasonable when:

- Your child is **generally well between waves** of pain
- No fever, no persistent vomiting, and your child is **drinking**
- Pain is mild–moderate, intermittent, and not rapidly worsening
- Pain improves with rest, passing gas/stool, or after a bowel movement

## Common Causes by Age

### Toddlers and preschoolers (roughly under 5)
Common:
- Constipation
- Viral gastroenteritis
- Urinary tract infection
- Swallowed air/gas, food intolerance

Higher caution:
- Intussusception (episodic severe pain, pallor, vomiting)
- Incarcerated hernia (groin swelling + distress)
- Appendicitis (can still occur, may present atypically)

### School-aged children
Common:
- Constipation
- Gastroenteritis
- Functional abdominal pain
- Appendicitis

### Adolescents
Common:
- Constipation, gastroenteritis, functional pain
- Menstrual-related pain (period cramps, ovulation pain)
- Urinary infections

Higher caution:
- Appendicitis
- Ovarian/testicular torsion (time-critical)

## The Big “Don’t Miss” Patterns

### Appendicitis (progressive pattern)
Often starts as vague pain near the belly button, then:
- Pain **moves to the lower right** abdomen (not always)
- Becomes **steadily worse**
- Appetite drops; nausea/vomiting may develop
- Walking, hopping, or bumps worsen pain

If your child has a pattern of **progressive pain + reduced appetite + movement pain**, get assessed.

### Gastroenteritis (viral “stomach bug”)
More likely when:
- Vomiting and/or diarrhoea are prominent
- Others at home/school are unwell
- Cramps come in waves

Main risk is **dehydration**, especially in younger children.

### Constipation (the most underestimated cause)
Consider constipation if:
- Hard stools, pain with stooling, or infrequent stools
- “Rabbit pellet” stools or large painful bowel movements
- Bloating, gassiness, reduced appetite
- Pain improves after passing stool or gas

Constipation can cause significant pain — and can coexist with other illness.

### Functional abdominal pain (stress-related pattern)
More likely when:
- Recurrent pain with normal exam/tests
- Child appears well between episodes
- Pattern fits school mornings, social stress, or anxiety
- No red flags, normal growth, no persistent fever/vomiting

This is real pain — the goal is symptom support and addressing triggers, not dismissing it.

## What You Can Do at Home

If there are **no red flags**:

### Fluids first
- Offer small, frequent sips of water or oral rehydration solution if vomiting/diarrhoea
- Aim for regular urination (a practical hydration marker)

### Gentle food
- Don’t force eating.
- Bland foods are okay if hungry (toast, rice, soup, banana), but hydration matters more.

### Comfort and monitoring
- Rest, warmth, and distraction can help.
- Re-check every few hours for worsening pain, new fever, vomiting, or reduced urination.

### Constipation support (if likely)
- Encourage fluids and fibre (as tolerated).
- If your local guidance supports a stool softener/laxative regimen, follow it — and see the dedicated constipation guide for a structured plan.

> Avoid giving new medicines (including anti-diarrhoeals) without guidance if your child is very young or unwell.

## When to Seek Medical Review Even If It’s Not “Emergency”

Arrange a review if:
- Pain persists beyond **48 hours**
- Pain recurs frequently (especially weekly or more)
- Weight loss, poor growth, persistent fatigue, or ongoing diarrhoea
- Blood in stool (even small amounts) or persistent vomiting
- Pain consistently wakes your child at night

## FAQ

**Q: My child says it’s “10/10” pain — is that automatically an emergency?**  
A: Not always. Children may describe intense pain from constipation or cramps. What matters most is **progression**, **associated symptoms**, and whether your child looks very unwell or cannot move comfortably.

**Q: What’s the single most important warning sign?**  
A: A child who looks very unwell (drowsy, pale, floppy) or pain that is **rapidly worsening** with vomiting/fever.

**Q: Can constipation still be the cause if my child is pooping daily?**  
A: Yes. Some children pass small stools while still being constipated (retained stool). Hard/painful stools, straining, and bloating are clues.

**Q: If it’s anxiety-related, should I still see a doctor?**  
A: Yes if the pattern is persistent, disrupting school/life, or if you’re unsure. Functional pain is common, but red flags always override pattern-based assumptions.
