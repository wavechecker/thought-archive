## Intro
A healthy diet is central to children’s growth, development, and lifelong health. Yet many families face food environments dominated by ultra-processed, sugary, and high-fat options. This guide outlines the basics of balanced nutrition for children and how families can support healthier choices.

## Key Points
- Balanced diets include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, protein, and dairy or alternatives.  
- Portion sizes vary by age, activity level, and growth stage.  
- Water should be the main drink; sugary beverages should be limited.  
- Healthy eating is shaped by availability, affordability, and culture.  
- Schools and communities play a major role in supporting healthy diets.  

## Background
Nutritional needs change rapidly through childhood and adolescence. Proper nutrition supports physical growth, brain development, immune function, and academic performance. Diets high in processed foods and sugar increase risks of obesity, type 2 diabetes, dental caries, and poor mental health outcomes.

## Causes or Mechanisms
- **Food environments**: Ubiquity of fast food, snacks, and sugary drinks.  
- **Family and culture**: Meal patterns and traditions influence habits.  
- **Affordability**: Fresh fruits, vegetables, and proteins may be more expensive.  
- **Advertising**: Children are heavily targeted with unhealthy food marketing.  

## Practical Strategies
- **Meals**: Emphasize whole foods — fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins.  
- **Snacks**: Offer nuts, yogurt, cheese, boiled eggs, or fruit instead of chips and sweets.  
- **Drinks**: Make water the default; limit juice and avoid sugary beverages.  
- **Breakfast**: Aim for protein + fiber (e.g., eggs and wholegrain toast, yogurt with oats and fruit).  
- **Family meals**: Eating together encourages healthier habits and portion control.  
- **Role modeling**: Caregivers set examples through their own diets.  
- **Shopping hacks**: Plan meals, read labels, shop the perimeter, keep healthy snacks visible.  
- **School partnership**: Review school canteen options; pack balanced lunches when possible.

## Risks / Prognosis
Poor diets in childhood can result in nutrient deficiencies, poor concentration and school performance, obesity, and increased risks for chronic diseases later in life. Balanced diets help protect against these risks and support lifelong health.

## FAQ
**Q: How much sugar is safe for children?**  
A: Aim for less than 10% of total energy from free sugars; below 5% is even better.

**Q: Should children take vitamin supplements?**  
A: Most children can get nutrients from food; supplements may be recommended if deficiencies are diagnosed or specific diets require them (e.g., B12 for vegan diets).

**Q: Are plant-based diets safe for children?**  
A: Yes, with careful planning to ensure adequate protein, vitamin B12, iron, calcium, vitamin D, and omega-3 sources.
