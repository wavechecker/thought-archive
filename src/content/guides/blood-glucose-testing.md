# Blood Glucose Testing — How and When to Check

Checking blood glucose is the simplest, most direct way to know what's happening right now. Even with a CGM, finger‑prick testing still matters.

## When to check
- **Before meals and before bed**
- **Before driving**
- **During and after exercise**
- **When sick or adjusting insulin**
- **If symptoms don't match CGM readings**

## Why it matters
- Early detection of highs/lows prevents accidents and hospital visits.
- Frequent checks improve pattern recognition.
- Supports safer insulin adjustments.
