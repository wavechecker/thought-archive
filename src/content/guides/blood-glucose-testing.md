# Blood Glucose Testing — How and When to Check

Checking blood glucose is the simplest and most direct way to know what’s happening in the moment. Even if you use a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), finger-prick testing still has an essential role.

## When to check
- **Before meals and before bed**
- **Before driving**
- **During and after exercise**
- **When sick or adjusting insulin**
- **If symptoms don’t match CGM readings**

## Why it matters
- Spotting highs and lows early prevents accidents and hospital visits.  
- Frequent checks = better pattern recognition.  
- Supports safer insulin adjustments.
