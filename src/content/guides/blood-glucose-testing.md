# Blood Glucose Testing — How and When to Check

Monitoring blood glucose is the backbone of safe diabetes care. Even if you use a CGM, finger-prick testing is still important.

## Key points
- Test before meals, before bed, and when feeling unwell.  
- Test before driving and during/after exercise.  
- Extra checks if sick, pregnant, or adjusting insulin.
