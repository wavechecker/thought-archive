# Global Vaccine Equity

## Intro
Vaccine equity refers to fair access to vaccines across populations and countries. While high-income nations often achieve high coverage, many low- and middle-income countries face barriers that leave communities vulnerable to preventable diseases.

## Key Points
- Inequitable access undermines global disease control.  
- Barriers include cost, supply chains, infrastructure, and political instability.  
- Initiatives like Gavi and COVAX aim to improve distribution.  
- Equity is both a moral imperative and a practical necessity for global health security.  

## Background
- **Historic gaps:** Polio, measles, and other vaccines have long been less accessible in poorer regions.  
- **COVID-19 pandemic:** Highlighted inequities sharply, with wealthy countries securing early doses while low-income nations lagged.  
- **Sustainable Development Goals:** Include vaccine equity as part of universal health coverage.  

## Challenges
- **Supply chains:** Cold-chain logistics are difficult in resource-limited settings.  
- **Financing:** Vaccines may be unaffordable without donor support.  
- **Conflict/instability:** Disrupts vaccination campaigns.  
- **Mistrust and misinformation:** Can limit uptake even when supply exists.  

## Solutions
- **Global alliances:** Gavi, UNICEF, WHO, and COVAX partnerships improve procurement and distribution.  
- **Tiered pricing:** Allows lower-income countries to access vaccines at reduced cost.  
- **Local manufacturing:** Expanding production in Africa, Asia, and Latin America to reduce dependency.  
- **Community engagement:** Building trust and demand is as vital as supply.  

## Risks / Benefits
- **Risks of inequity:** Outbreaks continue, variants emerge, preventable deaths persist.  
- **Benefits of equity:** Improves health outcomes, supports economic growth, and enhances global pandemic preparedness.  

## FAQ
**Q: Why should wealthy countries care about equity?**  
A: Infectious diseases cross borders. Outbreaks in one region can threaten global health security.  

**Q: Has COVAX solved the problem?**  
A: It improved access but struggled with supply constraints and vaccine nationalism during COVID-19.  

**Q: What’s the long-term fix?**  
A: Strengthening health systems, building regional manufacturing, and ensuring financing mechanisms are sustainable.
