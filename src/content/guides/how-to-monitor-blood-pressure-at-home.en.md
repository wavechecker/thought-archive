# How to Monitor Blood Pressure at Home — Step by Step

## Overview
Regularly checking your blood pressure at home can help you and your healthcare provider understand how well your treatment plan is working. Done correctly, home readings are an important part of managing hypertension.

## Key Points
- Use a validated, automatic, upper-arm blood pressure monitor.
- Take readings at the same times each day.
- Sit quietly for 5 minutes before measuring.
- Keep a log of your results.

## Step 1 — Choose the Right Equipment
- Select an **automatic cuff-style monitor** for the upper arm.
- Ensure it fits your arm circumference.
- Look for monitors validated by reputable organizations such as the American Heart Association.

## Step 2 — Prepare for the Measurement
- Avoid caffeine, smoking, or exercise for at least 30 minutes beforehand.
- Empty your bladder.
- Sit in a quiet place and relax for 5 minutes.

## Step 3 — Proper Positioning
- Sit with your back supported and feet flat on the floor.
- Rest your arm on a table so the cuff is at heart level.
- Do not talk or move during the measurement.

## Step 4 — Taking the Reading
- Wrap the cuff snugly around bare skin, not over clothing.
- Press the start button and remain still.
- Take two or three readings one minute apart and record the average.

## Step 5 — Recording Your Results
- Keep a written log or use the monitor’s app (if available).
- Include the date, time, and any relevant notes (e.g., stress, exercise, symptoms).

## Step 6 — When to Contact Your Doctor
- Consistently high readings (above 140/90 mmHg) over several days.
- Sudden spikes above 180/120 mmHg (hypertensive crisis).
- Significant drops causing dizziness or fainting.

## FAQs

**Q: Can I measure blood pressure over clothing?**  
A: No — this can produce inaccurate readings.

**Q: How often should I check my blood pressure?**  
A: If you’re starting treatment or adjusting medication, check daily for 1–2 weeks, then follow your doctor’s advice.

**Q: Are wrist or finger monitors accurate?**  
A: They are less reliable than upper-arm devices and should be used only if arm measurement is not possible.
