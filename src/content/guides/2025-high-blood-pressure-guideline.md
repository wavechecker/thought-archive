  - q: "What is new in the 2025 blood pressure guidelines?"
    a: "The 2025 guidelines emphasize earlier treatment, brain health protection, improved pregnancy care, and a new risk calculator to personalize treatment."
  - q: "When should I seek emergency care for high blood pressure?"
    a: "Seek emergency care if you have severely elevated blood pressure with symptoms like chest pain, severe headache, vision changes, confusion, or shortness of breath."
  - q: "Can high blood pressure affect my brain?"
    a: "Yes — uncontrolled hypertension can accelerate memory decline and increase the risk of dementia over time."
  - q: "What blood pressure medications are typically recommended?"
    a: "Common first-line medications include ACE inhibitors, ARBs, thiazide diuretics, and calcium channel blockers, chosen based on your individual health profile."
  - q: "Why is blood pressure control important during pregnancy?"
    a: "Proper blood pressure management before, during, and after pregnancy helps reduce the risk of preeclampsia and long-term heart complications for mothers."

# New 2025 High Blood Pressure Guideline: Prevention, Early Treatment, and Brain Health  

**Nearly half of U.S. adults have high blood pressure**, and it remains the leading preventable cause of heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, and now — cognitive decline. The new **2025 Joint Guideline from the American Heart Association (AHA) and American College of Cardiology (ACC)** takes aim at this risk with updated recommendations that replace the 2017 version.  

## What’s new in 2025?  

- **Earlier treatment, broader focus**  
  Lifestyle modification remains first-line, but early medication is emphasized to protect not just the heart, but also the brain. Research confirms hypertension accelerates memory decline and dementia.  

- **PREVENT™ risk calculator**  
  A new AHA tool to estimate **10- and 30-year cardiovascular risk**, integrating kidney and metabolic health, plus social determinants like zip code. This helps clinicians tailor treatment earlier.

- **Pregnancy and postpartum care**  
  The guideline urges tighter blood pressure control before, during, and after pregnancy to reduce preeclampsia, complications, and long-term maternal heart risk. Low-dose aspirin is recommended in select cases.  

- **Medication updates**  
  Core drug classes remain (ACE inhibitors, ARBs, thiazides, calcium channel blockers), but the guideline now notes **GLP-1 therapies** may benefit patients with both hypertension and obesity.  

- **Expanded testing**  
  - **Urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio** is now standard for all with hypertension (to detect kidney damage).  
  - **Plasma aldosterone/renin ratio** screening is broadened for detecting primary aldosteronism, especially in those with sleep apnea or stage 2 hypertension.
