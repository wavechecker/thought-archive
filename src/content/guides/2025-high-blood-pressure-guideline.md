# New 2025 High Blood Pressure Guideline: Prevention, Early Treatment, and Brain Health  

**Nearly half of U.S. adults have high blood pressure**, and it remains the leading preventable cause of heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, and now â€” cognitive decline. The new **2025 Joint Guideline from the American Heart Association (AHA) and American College of Cardiology (ACC)** takes aim at this risk with updated recommendations that replace the 2017 version.  

## Whatâ€™s new in 2025?  

- **Earlier treatment, broader focus**  
  Lifestyle modification remains first-line, but early medication is emphasized to protect not just the heart, but also the brain. Research confirms hypertension accelerates memory decline and dementia.  

- **PREVENTâ„¢ risk calculator**  
  A new AHA tool to estimate **10- and 30-year cardiovascular risk**, integrating kidney and metabolic health, plus social determinants like zip code. This helps clinicians tailor treatment earlier.

- **Pregnancy and postpartum care**  
  The guideline urges tighter blood pressure control before, during, and after pregnancy to reduce preeclampsia, complications, and long-term maternal heart risk. Low-dose aspirin is recommended in select cases.  

- **Medication updates**  
  Core drug classes remain (ACE inhibitors, ARBs, thiazides, calcium channel blockers), but the guideline now notes **GLP-1 therapies** may benefit patients with both hypertension and obesity.  

- **Expanded testing**  
  - **Urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio** is now standard for all with hypertension (to detect kidney damage).  
  - **Plasma aldosterone/renin ratio** screening is broadened for detecting primary aldosteronism, especially in those with sleep apnea or stage 2 hypertension.
