## Intro
Food and environmental allergies are common, but **anaphylaxis** is a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction. It can happen within minutes of exposure to an allergen, and requires **immediate emergency action**. Even a tiny exposure can trigger a reaction in sensitive individuals.

## Key Points
- Anaphylaxis is a **medical emergency** — use epinephrine (adrenaline) immediately.  
- Common triggers: peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish, milk, eggs, insect stings, certain medicines.  
- Symptoms can progress quickly — from hives and swelling to breathing difficulty and collapse.  
- Always call emergency services, even after epinephrine use.  
- People at risk should carry an **auto-injector and action plan** at all times.  

## Common Allergens
- Peanuts and tree nuts  
- Shellfish and fish  
- Milk and eggs  
- Wheat and soy  
- Sesame  
- Insect stings and some medicines (e.g., antibiotics, NSAIDs)  

## Symptoms
- **Mild/moderate**: itching, hives, swelling of lips/face, abdominal pain, vomiting  
- **Severe (anaphylaxis)**: difficulty breathing, wheezing, swelling of tongue/throat, dizziness, fainting, collapse  

## First Aid for Anaphylaxis ⚠️
1. **Use epinephrine auto-injector immediately** (e.g., EpiPen).  
2. **Call emergency services**.  
3. Lay the person flat with legs elevated — unless breathing is very difficult (then allow sitting up).  
4. If no improvement after 5–10 minutes, give a **second dose** if available.  
5. Monitor breathing and circulation — be prepared to start CPR if necessary.  

## Prevention
- Read food and medicine labels carefully.  
- Avoid cross-contamination when preparing food.  
- Inform restaurants, schools, and workplaces about allergies.  
- Carry an **action plan** and wear medical alert jewellery.  

## FAQ
**Q: Why use epinephrine first and not antihistamines?**  
A: Epinephrine is the only life-saving treatment for anaphylaxis. Antihistamines may help mild symptoms (like hives) but do not stop airway or circulation collapse.  

**Q: Do I still need to go to the hospital if symptoms improve?**  
A: Yes. A reaction can return (biphasic reaction), so medical monitoring is essential.  

**Q: Can children outgrow food allergies?**  
A: Some do (e.g., milk or egg), but others (like peanut and tree nut) often persist. Always follow up with an allergy specialist.
