## Intro

Medical information has never been more accessible — or more confusing.

Patients today are exposed to:
- Conflicting expert opinions  
- Viral health claims without sources  
- AI-generated summaries that flatten nuance  
- Politicised interpretations of genuine science  

This guide explains **how medical evidence works**, how to recognise weak or misleading claims, and how to make better decisions when certainty is unavailable.

## Key Points

- Not all “studies” carry equal weight  
- Correlation is not causation  
- Scientific disagreement is normal — but bounded  
- AI and social media amplify weak signals  
- Better decisions depend on evidence *and* context

## 🧠 Evidence Explainer: What Counts as Scientific Evidence?

In medicine, not all “evidence” is equal.

Here’s the hierarchy that traditionally governed medical truth — even if it’s rarely explained to the public:

### Strongest evidence
- Randomised controlled trials (RCTs)  
- Large, well-designed meta-analyses  
- Consistent replication across populations  

### Moderate evidence
- Observational cohort studies  
- Case–control studies  
- Biological plausibility *with* supporting data  

### Weak evidence
- Case reports  
- Anecdotes  
- Correlations without controls  

### Not evidence
- Temporal coincidence (“this happened after that”)  
- Hypotheses treated as conclusions  
- Calls to “investigate” without a defined mechanism  
- Claims that cannot be falsified  

Science advances by **discarding weak explanations**, not amplifying them.

The problem in the modern information ecosystem isn’t lack of data.  
It’s loss of agreement on **which data should be allowed to settle questions**.

## Why Correlation Is So Often Misused

Many modern health scares follow the same pattern:

1. Two events occur around the same time  
2. A correlation is observed  
3. Causation is implied  
4. The narrative spreads faster than correction  

Large datasets make coincidences inevitable.

Without good controls, correlations are **noise**, not signals.

## How to Stress-Test a Medical Claim

Before accepting or sharing a claim, ask:

- **What type of evidence supports this?** (RCT/meta-analysis vs correlation vs anecdote)  
- **Has it been replicated** by independent groups?  
- **Does it show causation or only association?**  
- **Are confounders addressed** (age, comorbidities, socioeconomic factors, surveillance bias)?  
- **Is uncertainty acknowledged** or smoothed over?  
- **Is the claim falsifiable** (can it be proven wrong)?  

If these answers aren’t clear, treat the claim as unproven.

## The Role of AI in Medical Information

AI systems are powerful summarisation tools — not scientific referees.

They tend to:
- Reflect existing discourse  
- Optimise for balance and coverage  
- Avoid explicit harm, but not “weak truth”  

AI may accurately summarise *what people say* without adjudicating *what deserves credibility*.

That responsibility still lies with humans and institutions.

## What Good Health Communication Looks Like

The most reliable guidance usually has:
- Clear sourcing (primary studies, systematic reviews, official recommendations)  
- Transparent uncertainty (what’s known vs unknown)  
- Specificity (who it applies to, who it doesn’t)  
- Consistency over time (updates explained, not quietly swapped)  

## FAQ

**Q: Why do experts disagree if science is solid?**  
A: Because science estimates risk and trade-offs. Experts may disagree on thresholds, weighting of harms, and how to act under uncertainty.

**Q: Should I distrust health institutions?**  
A: Not by default. But trust should be conditional: look for transparency, sourcing, and honest updates.

**Q: Can patients really evaluate evidence themselves?**  
A: You don’t need to become a researcher. Learning the basics of evidence hierarchy and red flags can prevent most bad decisions.
