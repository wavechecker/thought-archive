# Preventing Heart Disease: Lifestyle and Medical Screening

Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of illness and death worldwide. The good news is that **many risk factors are modifiable** — meaning you can take steps to lower your chances of developing problems.

## Lifestyle Steps

### Healthy Diet
- Emphasize fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats.  
- Limit processed foods, added sugars, and excess salt.  
- Aim for portion control and balanced meals.  

### Regular Physical Activity
- At least **150 minutes per week** of moderate aerobic activity (e.g., brisk walking, cycling).  
- Add **strength training** 2–3 times per week.  
- Reduce sitting time with regular movement breaks.  

### Quit Smoking & Moderate Alcohol
- Stopping smoking is one of the most powerful ways to protect your heart.  
- Limit alcohol to recommended guidelines or avoid altogether.  

### Manage Stress & Sleep
- Stress management: mindfulness, relaxation, or counselling.  
- Aim for **7–9 hours of quality sleep** per night.  

## Medical Screening & Risk Factor Management
- **Blood pressure checks**: high blood pressure often has no symptoms.  
- **Cholesterol tests**: high cholesterol contributes to atherosclerosis.  
- **Diabetes screening**: manage blood glucose early to reduce complications.  
- **Weight/BMI**: maintain a healthy weight.  
- **Family history**: be aware if relatives had early heart disease.

## When to Seek Medical Advice
- If you have chest pain, unexplained breathlessness, or palpitations.  
- If you have multiple risk factors (e.g., high blood pressure + smoking + diabetes).  
- Discuss whether medications (e.g., statins, blood pressure tablets) may help lower your risk.
