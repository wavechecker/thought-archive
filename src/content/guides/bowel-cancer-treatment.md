# Treatment Pathways — Surgery, Chemo, Radiotherapy

Treatment depends on the **stage of the cancer** and your **overall health**. Most people are treated within a **multidisciplinary team** (MDT) that includes surgeons, oncologists, radiologists, and specialist nurses.

## Key Pathways

### Surgery
- Often the first-line treatment.  
- May involve removing part of the bowel (colectomy) with nearby lymph nodes.  
- Can be open or laparoscopic ("keyhole") surgery.  
- In some cases, a stoma (colostomy/ileostomy) may be required temporarily or permanently.

### Chemotherapy
- Used to **reduce recurrence risk** after surgery (adjuvant therapy).  
- May shrink tumours before surgery (neoadjuvant therapy).  
- Also used in advanced disease to slow progression and manage symptoms.  
- Common drugs: 5-FU, capecitabine, oxaliplatin.

### Radiotherapy
- More common in **rectal cancer** than colon cancer.  
- Often given before surgery to shrink tumours and reduce local recurrence risk.  
- May be combined with chemotherapy (chemoradiotherapy).

## What to Expect
- **Side effects** vary depending on treatment: fatigue, nausea, diarrhoea, or neuropathy.  
- MDT teams provide **supportive care**: dietetics, stoma nurses, psychosocial support.  
- Regular follow-up with scans and blood tests (including CEA) is standard after treatment.
