# Skin Cancer — Prevention

Australia has some of the **highest skin cancer rates in the world**.  

- More than **two in three Australians** will face a skin cancer diagnosis in their lifetime.  
- In **2024**, there were **18,964 new melanoma cases** and **1,340 deaths**.  
- By age 85, **1 in 14 men** and **1 in 21 women** will be diagnosed with melanoma.  
- Some regions, like **South-East Queensland**, record melanoma rates nearly **double the national average**.  

The good news: **most skin cancers are preventable** with consistent protection.  

**Summary**  
Protect your skin every day — with clothing, shade, and sunscreen — especially during peak UV hours.  

## Key Prevention Strategies
- **Slip on clothing**: Long sleeves, tightly woven fabrics.  
- **Slop on sunscreen**: Broad-spectrum SPF 30+ (or higher), applied generously and reapplied every 2 hours.  
- **Slap on a hat**: Wide-brimmed for best coverage.  
- **Seek shade**: Especially between **10am and 4pm**, when UV radiation is strongest.  
- **Slide on sunglasses**: Wraparound for maximum eye protection.  
- **Avoid tanning beds**: Increases melanoma risk.  

## Daily Habits
- Check the UV index. In Australia, sun protection is recommended when the UV index is **3 or higher**.  
- Make sun protection part of your morning routine — even on cloudy days.  
- Reapply sunscreen after swimming, sweating, or toweling off.  

## FAQs
**Q: Isn’t sunscreen enough?**  
A: Sunscreen is important, but it should be combined with hats, clothing, and shade for best protection.  

**Q: Do I need sun protection in winter?**  
A: Yes, if the UV index is 3 or above. In many parts of Australia, that includes winter.  

**Q: Can kids use adult sunscreen?**
