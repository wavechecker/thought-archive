## Intro
Severe bleeding (hemorrhage) is a life-threatening emergency. Without rapid control, a person can lose critical blood volume within minutes. Knowing how to apply basic first aid before professional help arrives can save lives.

## Key Points
- Severe bleeding can be fatal in **under 5 minutes**.  
- Apply **direct pressure** immediately with a clean cloth or your hand.  
- Call emergency services right away.  
- If bleeding doesn’t stop, apply a **tourniquet** (limb only).  
- Keep the person calm and still to slow blood loss.  

## Warning Signs
- Blood that won’t stop with pressure  
- Spurting or pulsating blood (arterial bleeding)  
- Large pools of blood or soaked clothing/bandages  
- Signs of shock: pale, clammy skin, rapid pulse, confusion  

## First Aid Steps
1. **Call emergency services** immediately.  
2. **Apply firm, direct pressure** on the wound using a clean cloth, bandage, or your hand.  
3. If possible, **raise the injured limb** above heart level.  
4. If bleeding continues:  
   - Keep pressure constant.  
   - Add more bandages on top (don’t remove soaked ones).  
   - Apply a **tourniquet** if trained and bleeding is life-threatening.  
5. **Monitor for shock**: lay the person down, keep them warm, reassure them.  

## Tourniquet Use
- Place 5–7 cm (2–3 inches) above the wound, not on a joint.  
- Tighten until bleeding stops.  
- Note the time — medical teams need to know how long it’s been in place.  
- Only use when direct pressure fails and bleeding is life-threatening.  

## Risks and Prognosis
- Quick first aid greatly improves survival.  
- Delay in controlling bleeding leads to shock, organ failure, and death.  
- Even if bleeding is controlled, urgent medical care is required to repair damage and prevent infection.  

## FAQ
**Q: What if I don’t have a bandage?**  
A: Use any clean cloth, clothing, or even your hand with firm pressure.  

**Q: Should I remove soaked bandages?**  
A: No — place additional layers on top. Removing them may restart bleeding.  

**Q: Can bleeding stop on its own?**  
A: Minor bleeding may, but **severe bleeding will not**. Always treat as an emergency.
