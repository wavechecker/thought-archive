## Intro
Metabolic health and mental health are closely connected. Research shows that poor metabolic health—such as insulin resistance, excess visceral fat, and disrupted sleep—raises the risk of depression, anxiety, fatigue, and cognitive decline. This guide explains how the link works, why it matters, and the options for improving both sides of the equation.

## Key Points
- Poor metabolic health is associated with higher rates of depression and anxiety.  
- Inflammation, insulin resistance, hormonal disruption, and sleep problems influence brain function.  
- Mental illness also contributes to poor metabolic health, creating a bi-directional loop.  
- Improving metabolic factors—sleep, exercise, visceral fat, insulin sensitivity—often improves mood.  
- Managing both mental and metabolic health together is usually more effective than targeting either alone.

## Background
Metabolic health refers to how efficiently the body regulates energy, hormones, glucose, and inflammation. Mental health involves emotional regulation, mood, cognition, and behaviour. These systems constantly communicate through the nervous system, immune system, and hormones.

Research now supports a strong connection between the two: metabolic disorders increase the likelihood of depression and anxiety, while mental health conditions often worsen metabolic markers.

## Causes or Mechanisms

### Inflammation
Visceral fat produces inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6, TNF-α) that travel to the brain and disturb mood-regulating pathways. Chronic inflammation is a known contributor to depression and anxiety.

### Insulin resistance
The brain depends on stable glucose and insulin signalling. Insulin resistance can lead to:
- fatigue  
- reduced reward signalling  
- impaired concentration  
- worsening depressive symptoms  

People with type 2 diabetes have about twice the risk of major depression.

### Hormonal disruption
Poor metabolic health affects testosterone, oestrogen, thyroid hormones, and cortisol rhythms—each influencing energy, motivation, mood, and sleep.

### Sleep disturbance
Short or fragmented sleep increases appetite hormones, disrupts insulin, and raises stress hormones. Sleep apnea—often linked with visceral fat—significantly increases depression and anxiety risk.

### Lifestyle feedback loops
Low mood reduces activity, worsens sleep, increases emotional eating, and increases alcohol use. These behaviours worsen metabolic health.
