## Overview
Skin cancer diagnosis starts with a **clinical exam** and may involve dermoscopy, biopsy, and staging tests. Early detection allows for simpler, more effective treatment.

---

## Key Points
- **Visual exam** is the first step in diagnosis.  
- **Dermoscopy** improves accuracy for identifying suspicious lesions.  
- **Biopsy** confirms the diagnosis.  
- **Staging** determines how advanced the cancer is, guiding treatment decisions.  

---

## Diagnosis Process
1. **Skin Exam:** Doctor checks for suspicious spots or changes.  
2. **Dermoscopy:** Handheld device provides magnified view.  
3. **Biopsy:** Excision, shave, or punch biopsy confirms diagnosis.  
4. **Staging Tests:** Ultrasound, CT, MRI, or sentinel lymph node biopsy may be done if advanced disease is suspected.

## FAQ
**Q: How is skin cancer diagnosed?**  
A: Through visual exam, dermoscopy, and confirmed by biopsy.  

**Q: What is dermoscopy?**  
A: A magnified light exam that helps doctors see under the skin surface.  

**Q: What is a biopsy?**  
A: A small skin sample analyzed under a microscope to detect cancer cells.  

**Q: How is skin cancer staged?**  
A: Based on tumor thickness, lymph node involvement, and spread to distant organs.
