# Statins — Benefits, Risks, and Common Myths

Statins — Benefits, Risks, and Common Myths
Overview

Statins lower cholesterol and reduce risk of heart attack and stroke. They’re among the most widely prescribed medicines.

Rarely: fatty deposits in skin or around eyes

Causes / Risk Factors

High LDL (“bad cholesterol”)

Smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure

Family history of early heart disease

What To Do Now

Don’t stop statins suddenly without medical advice

Discuss side effects early; many are manageable

Combine with lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, weight control)

Diagnosis & Treatment

Blood cholesterol checks guide treatment

Statins reduce risk by stabilising artery plaques

Some need higher doses or combination therapy

Prevention / Daily Management

Follow prescribed schedule (usually once daily)

Monitor blood tests as advised

Avoid excess grapefruit juice (can interfere with metabolism)
