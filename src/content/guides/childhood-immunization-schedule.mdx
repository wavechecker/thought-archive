## Intro
Childhood vaccines protect against serious infections like measles, whooping cough, and polio.  
This guide lays out the **typical schedule**, explains **why combination vaccines (like MMR)** are used, and shows **how to catch up** if you fall behind.

> **Note on regions:** Schedules vary by country. Use this as a clear overview, then check your national program for exact timing and brand names.

## Key Points
- Combination vaccines (e.g., **MMR**) are used to **reduce injections** and **improve coverage** without sacrificing safety or effectiveness.
- If you miss a dose, you **don’t restart** — you **catch up** with the next age-appropriate dose and interval.
- Mild reactions (fever, soreness) are common; **serious adverse events are rare**.
- Keeping routine coverage high prevents outbreaks (e.g., the 2025 measles resurgence).

## Background
Routine immunization layers protection across infancy and early childhood, when risks from infections are highest.  
Schedules are designed to **maximize protection** when children are most vulnerable and to **minimize visits** using combo vaccines tested together.

## The Schedule at a Glance (Typical Pattern)
> Exact timing varies by country. This table shows common ages and combinations you’ll see in many national schedules.

| Age | Vaccines (common abbreviations) | Protects Against | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Birth** | HepB #1 | Hepatitis B | Given within 24 hours where recommended. |
| **6–8 weeks** | DTaP-IPV-HepB-Hib #1 (combo), PCV #1, Rotavirus #1 | Diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis; polio; hepatitis B; Hib; pneumococcal; rotavirus | Some programs give MenB #1 here. |
| **4 months** | DTaP-IPV-HepB-Hib #2, PCV #2, Rotavirus #2 | Same as above | Rotavirus may be 2-dose or 3-dose series depending on brand. |
| **6 months** | DTaP-IPV-HepB-Hib #3 (where used), Influenza (seasonal) | Same + flu | Some schedules place the 3rd primary DTaP/Hib/IPV later. |
| **12 months** | **MMR #1**, PCV booster, Hib booster | Measles, mumps, rubella; pneumococcal; Hib | In some regions MMRV (adds varicella) after 12–15 months. |
| **15–18 months** | DTaP booster, Varicella #1 (if not MMRV) | Pertussis; chickenpox | Timing varies; some give MMRV here. |
| **4–6 years** | **MMR #2**, DTaP-IPV booster | Measles, mumps, rubella; tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis; polio | School-entry boosters. |
| **11–12 years** | Tdap, HPV #1, MenACWY #1 | Pertussis booster; HPV-related cancers; meningococcal | HPV: 2 doses if started ≤14; 3 doses if ≥15. |
| **16 years** | MenACWY booster; consider MenB series | Meningococcal | MenB timing varies by program and risk. |

### Why Combination Vaccines Exist
- **Fewer needles & visits** → better adherence.
- **Simpler logistics** → fewer errors, higher coverage.
- **Tested together** → no loss of safety or immune response.

## Catch-Up Basics
- **Never restart** a vaccine series due to delay.
- Respect **minimum intervals** between doses (varies by product).
- Prior disease (e.g., chickenpox) or documented immunity may change what’s needed.
- For accelerated travel needs, clinicians may **compress intervals** within safety limits.

## Risks / Benefits / Prognosis
- **Benefits:** Prevents severe disease, complications, and outbreaks; protects vulnerable infants and immunocompromised people through herd effects.
- **Risks:** Mostly mild and short-lived (fever, soreness). Serious reactions are **rare** and monitored by pharmacovigilance systems.
- **Outlook:** Maintaining high coverage keeps communities open, kids in school, and hospitals focused on true emergencies.

## FAQ
**Q: Can I get MMR as three separate shots?**  
A: Some regions permit separate components, but **MMR as a combined vaccine is standard** — fewer shots, same safety and protection.

**Q: My child had COVID-19. Does that change the routine schedule?**  
A: COVID vaccination is a **separate** decision from the routine schedule. Follow your national COVID guidance alongside the routine schedule.

**Q: Are aluminum adjuvants safe?**  
A: Yes. The amounts used are **very small** and help the immune response. Total exposure is lower than everyday sources like food.

**Q: What if my child has an egg allergy?**  
A: Most routine vaccines are safe; discuss specifics (like some flu vaccines) with your clinician.

**Q: Where do I find my country’s exact schedule?**  
A: Check your national health authority (e.g., ministries of health, CDC/EMA/WHO regional pages).
