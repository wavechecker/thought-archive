## Intro
Children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) can thrive at school when staff understand a few essentials:  
- **Monitoring glucose** and supporting insulin/meal routines.  
- **Treating lows fast** without delay.  
- Knowing **what to do for highs/ketones** and when to escalate.  
- Having a clear, shared **Diabetes Care Plan (DCP)**.  

The goal is equal participation in learning, sports, and social activities while keeping the student safe.

---

## Key Points
- Every student with T1D needs a **written DCP** on file.  
- **Never delay urgent treatment** — treat hypos where the student is.  
- Staff must be trained to **recognize and act on hypos/hypers** immediately.  
- Allow free access to **glucose checks, snacks, water, and toilets**.  
- Plan ahead for **PE, exams, and school trips**.  

---

## Diabetes Care Plan (DCP) — What to Include
- Student details, parent/guardian contacts, clinician info.  
- Target ranges, CGM use, meter/strips location.  
- Insulin regimen: **MDI** (doses/timing) or **pump** (basal/bolus/temp basal).  
- **Hypo treatment protocol** (15–20 g fast carbs, recheck in 15 min).  
- **Severe hypo** plan: glucagon (nasal/injectable), who can give, when to call emergency.  
- **Hyperglycaemia/ketone protocol**: when to test, correction doses, fluids.  
- Permissions: self-managing vs. staff-assisted.  
- Storage: snacks, spare supplies, **backup pen/syringes**, infusion sets/sensors.  

---

## Daily Routines at School
- **Supplies on-site:** meter/CGM reader, hypo kit, spare sensors/sets.  
- **Meals/snacks:** allow time for carb counting and bolusing.  
- **Free access** to water and restrooms.  
- **Where to treat:** student may treat in class or nearby safe space —  
  ⚠️ **Do not send a hypoglycaemic student alone.**

---

## Recognising & Treating Lows
**Symptoms:** shakiness, sweats, pallor, irritability, fatigue, trouble concentrating.  

**Action:**  
- Give **15–20 g fast carbs** immediately (glucose tabs/gel/juice).  
- **Recheck after 15 minutes.**  
- If unconscious or unable to swallow: give **glucagon** and call emergency services.  

---

## Highs & Ketones
- If glucose **>13.9 mmol/L (250 mg/dL)** and unwell or pump issue suspected → **check ketones**.  
- Encourage **water**; follow DCP for correction insulin.  
- Pump users: check site/tubing, give correction by pen/syringe if needed.  

**Red Flags — Call Emergency Services**  
- Vomiting, abdominal pain, rapid or deep breathing.  
- Confusion, extreme drowsiness.  

---

## PE / Sports
- Check glucose before activity; keep **fast carbs on hand**.  
- Strenuous/long activity: adjust basal/bolus or give extra carbs.  
- Watch for **delayed lows** (can occur hours later, even overnight).  

---

## Exams & Tests
- Allow **meters/CGM/phones** (silent/airplane mode if needed) and hypo treatment at desk.  
- If hypo/hyper occurs, allow **pause + treatment**, then resume.  
- Schools should provide **extra time** if diabetes interrupts testing.  

---

## School Trips & Camps
- Take **double supplies** (meters, strips, ketones, infusion sets, chargers, glucagon).  
- Share DCP with trip leaders; identify nearest medical facility.  
- Assign a **named adult** trained in T1D care for the trip.  
- Plan basal/bolus adjustments for activity; bring plenty of snacks.  

---

## Communication & Training
- Annual training for staff in contact with the student.  
- Agree on signals for breaks/treatment; update substitute teachers.  
- Maintain a **log** of significant events (severe hypos, ketones, site failures).  

---

## Legal & Policy Basics
- Students with T1D are entitled to **reasonable accommodations** (varies by country).  
- Examples:  
  - **US:** 504 Plan or IEP.  
  - **UK:** Individual Healthcare Plan under statutory guidance.  
  - **AU:** Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) obligations.  
- Parents should share the DCP and update annually.  

---

## FAQ
**Can a student treat a low in class?**  
Yes — treating immediately on the spot is safest. Never send them away alone.  

**Who can give glucagon?**  
Staff trained per school policy. Nasal glucagon is often simpler to use.  

**Are CGMs/phones allowed in exams?**  
Yes, with accommodations. Must be silent/airplane mode if required.
