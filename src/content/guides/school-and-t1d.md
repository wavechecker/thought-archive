## Intro
Children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) can participate fully in school when staff understand the basics: **monitoring glucose**, **treating lows fast**, supporting **meals/insulin**, and knowing **who to call**.

## Key Points
- Every student should have a **written Diabetes Care Plan** (DCP) on file.
- Staff must know **how to recognize and treat hypos** immediately.
- Allow access to **glucose checks, snacks, water, and toilets** without delay.
- Plan ahead for **PE/sports, exams, and trips**.

## Diabetes Care Plan (DCP) — What to Include
- Student details, parent/guardian contacts, clinician info.
- Typical targets, CGM use, meter/strips location.
- Insulin method: **MDI** (doses, timing) or **pump** (basal, bolus, temp basal).
- **Hypoglycaemia treatment protocol** (15–20 g fast carbs; repeat after 15 min).
- **Severe hypo** plan: **glucagon** (brand/dose), who can administer, when to call emergency services.
- **Hyperglycaemia** and **ketone** guidance (when to test, correction doses, fluids).
- Permissions: student self-managing vs. staff assistance.
- Storage: snacks, spare supplies, **backup pen/syringes**, spare infusion sets/sensors.

## Daily Routines at School
- **Before class:** ensure supplies are on-site (meter/CGM reader, hypo kit, spare sensors/sets).
- **Meals/snacks:** allow time for **carb counting** and bolusing.
- **Free access** to water and restroom for highs.
- **Where to treat:** student may treat in class or a nearby safe space—**don’t send alone** when hypo.

## Recognising & Treating Lows
**Symptoms:** shakiness, sweats, pallor, irritability, difficulty concentrating, sudden fatigue.  
**Action:** give **15–20 g fast carbs** (glucose tabs/gel/juice). **Recheck after 15 min.**  
If unconscious or unable to swallow: give **glucagon** (nasal or injectable) and call emergency services.

## Highs & Ketones
- If glucose **>13.9 mmol/L (250 mg/dL)** and unwell or pump issues suspected → **check ketones**.
- Encourage **water**; follow the DCP for correction insulin and recheck timing.
- For pump users with unexpected highs, inspect site/tubing; consider a pen/syringe correction per plan.

## PE / Sports
- Check glucose before activity; have **fast carbs** on hand.
- For long/strenuous activity: consider **temp basal reduction** (pump) or extra carbs per DCP.
- Watch for **delayed lows** after afternoon sports.

## Exams & Tests
- Allow **meters/CGM/phones** (in airplane/silent mode if required) and hypo treatment at desk.
- If hypo/hyper occurs during an exam, **pause** and treat; offer extra time as per policy.

## School Trips & Camps
- Take **two** of everything: meters, strips, ketone strips, infusion sets/sensors, batteries/chargers, glucagon.
- Share the DCP with trip leaders; identify the nearest medical facility.
- Consider activity-related basal/bolus adjustments; bring plenty of snacks.

## Communication & Training
- Annual training for staff who work with the student.
- Agree on signals for the student to leave class to treat; update substitutes.
- Maintain a **log** of significant events (severe hypos, ketones, site failures).

## Legal & Policy Basics
- Students with T1D are typically entitled to **reasonable accommodations** to ensure equal access to education (varies by country). Keep the DCP on file and review annually.

## FAQ
**Can a student treat a low in class?**  
Yes—fast treatment where they are is safest. Do not send a hypoglycaemic student alone.

**Who can give glucagon?**  
Staff trained per school policy/DCP. Nasal glucagon is simple to use.

**Phones/CGMs in exams?**  
Allowed with accommodations—confirm with exam board/school policy and set to silent/airplane mode if needed.
