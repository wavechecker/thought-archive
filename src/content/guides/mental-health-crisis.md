## Overview
Mental health conditions affect more than **one billion people worldwide**. They are a leading cause of disability, yet often go untreated due to stigma, limited resources, and lack of access to care. The hopeful reality is that effective treatments exist—ranging from therapy and medication to lifestyle and community support. Recovery is possible, and early intervention makes a real difference.  

This hub brings together guides on depression, anxiety, suicide prevention, and the global mental health crisis—providing clear, evidence-based information and pathways toward support, treatment, and hope.
