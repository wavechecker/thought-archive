# Natural Testosterone Optimisation Guide for Men

Testosterone influences muscle strength, mood, libido, cognition, confidence, and metabolic health.  
While levels decline gradually with age, **modern lifestyle factors lower testosterone far more than biology**.

This guide outlines **drug-free, evidence-based methods** to optimise testosterone using nutrition, sleep, training, micronutrients, and behavioural strategies.

## 1. Nutrition: Build Hormones Through Diet

Testosterone synthesis requires cholesterol and adequate energy availability.

### Healthy fats
Support hormone production:

- Olive oil, avocado  
- Whole eggs  
- Nuts (macadamia, almonds)  
- Oily fish  
- Beef, lamb  
- Butter or ghee  

**Target:** 30–40% of daily calories from fat.

### Protein for hormonal signalling  
Aim for **1.6–2.2 g/kg/day** to support lean mass and recovery.

### Carbohydrates strategically  
Very low-carb diets may raise cortisol and suppress testosterone.  
Use carbs **around training** and on heavy lifting days.

---

## 2. Training: Lift Intensely, Briefly

Testosterone responds to mechanical tension and neural drive.

### Most effective protocol
- 3–4 sessions per week  
- 45–60 minutes  
- Lower reps (3–6), higher loads  
- Compound lifts (deadlifts, squats, bench, overhead press, rows, pull-ups)

Avoid chronic cardio and overtraining—both elevate cortisol.

---

## 3. Sleep: The Largest Natural Testosterone Booster

Up to **80% of testosterone** is produced during sleep.

### Testosterone-suppressing sleep issues
- <6 hours sleep  
- Frequent awakenings  
- Snoring or sleep apnea  
- Late meals or alcohol  

### Targets
- 7.5–8.5 hours nightly  
- Cool, dark sleeping environment  
- Avoid screens before bed  
- No food within 3 hours of sleep  

<StratBox title="Sleep Support">
- Magnesium glycinate 300–400 mg  
- Morning sunlight  
- Keep room <19°C  
</StratBox>

## 4. Body Composition: Reduce Visceral Fat

Visceral fat converts testosterone to estrogen via aromatase.

A reduction of **5–10% waist circumference** may increase testosterone by **15–25%**.

---

## 5. Micronutrients: Correct Hidden Deficiencies

### Vitamin D  
Strong association with testosterone.

### Zinc  
Essential for LH (testosterone signalling).

### Magnesium  
Improves sleep and reduces cortisol.

### Typical supplementation
- Vitamin D3: 2,000–5,000 IU/day  
- Magnesium glycinate: 300–400 mg nightly  
- Zinc: 15–30 mg/day (short-term)

<Note>
Testing levels is ideal. Supplementation is most effective when correcting deficiency.
</Note>

## 6. Manage Testosterone-Suppressing Factors

- Alcohol (even moderate intake reduces testosterone for 24–48 hours)  
- Chronic stress  
- Ultra-low calorie dieting  
- Plastics and endocrine disruptors  
- Overtraining  

---

## 7. Behavioural Drivers

### Sunlight  
Improves vitamin D and nitric oxide pathways.

### Sexual activity  
Increases testosterone and LH.

### Competition and achievement  
Testosterone rises in states of dominance, focus, and progression.

Behaviour influences biology as much as biology influences behaviour.

---

## 8. Optional Lab Evaluation

Useful tests:

- Total testosterone  
- Free testosterone  
- SHBG  
- LH + FSH  
- Prolactin  
- Estradiol (E2)  
- Vitamin D  
- TSH + Free T4 + **T3**

These help identify which pathways need optimisation.

---

## 9. When to Avoid TRT (Testosterone Replacement Therapy)

TRT is powerful, but:

- Suppresses natural production  
- Reduces fertility  
- Requires lifelong management  

Lifestyle optimisation should be first-line unless confirmed hypogonadism persists.

---

## Summary

Natural testosterone optimisation strengthens:

- Mood & motivation  
- Strength & muscle  
- Sexual function  
- Energy  
- Metabolic health  
- Long-term resilience  

Lifestyle changes are **safe, sustainable, and clinically meaningful**—and for most men, overwhelmingly effective.
