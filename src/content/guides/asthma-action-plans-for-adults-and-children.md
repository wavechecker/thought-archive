An **Asthma Action Plan** is a personalised written guide that helps you recognise worsening asthma and take the right steps to keep it under control.  
It’s a tool for both **day-to-day management** and **emergency response**.

### Why have one?
- Reduces the risk of hospital visits.
- Helps spot early signs of flare-ups.
- Gives clear instructions to family, carers, or school staff.

### What it includes
1. **Daily management** — which preventer and reliever medicines to take and when.  
2. **Symptom zones** —  
   - *Green*: Well controlled. Continue usual medicines.  
   - *Yellow*: Increasing symptoms (e.g., coughing, wheezing). Step up reliever use as directed.  
   - *Red*: Severe symptoms (difficulty speaking, blueness, rapid breathing) — seek urgent help.  
3. **Emergency contacts** — your doctor, local emergency services.

### For children
Give a copy to school staff, coaches, and babysitters. Review it at least once a year or after any hospital visit.

**Tip:** Keep your Asthma Action Plan with you or saved on your phone for quick access in emergencies.
