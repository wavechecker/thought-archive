<StratBox title="Key Insight">
Sustainable weight loss happens when you protect your metabolism — not when you punish it.  
Consistency and regular meals beat extremes every time.
</StratBox>

### ⚙️ 1. Reset your metabolism, don’t punish it
Skipping meals or cycling between fasting and binging spikes cortisol and drives overeating later.  
Eat **three balanced meals** plus one optional snack to stabilize blood sugar and appetite hormones.

---

### 🍳 2. Prioritize protein
Aim for **1.6–2.0 g per kg body weight** from eggs, lean meats, fish, or lentils.  
Protein maintains muscle, improves satiety, and raises calorie burn through thermogenesis.

---

### 🥦 3. Keep carbs smart and strategic
Choose **low-GI, nutrient-dense** carbs:
- Vegetables, lentils, small fruit portions  
- Banana before workouts to fuel training  
- Berries or orange slices post-workout for recovery  
Avoid large refined-carb loads that spike insulin.

---

### 🧂 4. Balance electrolytes
Low-carb diets increase sodium loss.  
Use sea salt to taste and include **potassium (avocado, mushrooms)** and **magnesium (nuts, greens)** daily.

---

### ⚖️ 5. Create a gentle deficit
A moderate 15–25 % calorie deficit (≈ 1,800–2,000 kcal for most adults) promotes fat loss without slowing metabolism or causing rebound hunger.

---

### 🏋️ 6. Exercise to preserve, not punish
Combine:
- **Resistance training (3–4×/week)** — protects lean mass  
- **Moderate cardio (2×/week)** — supports insulin sensitivity  
Move often but don’t chase exhaustion.

---

### 😌 7. Sleep & stress count
Poor sleep and chronic stress elevate cortisol and appetite.  
Aim for 7–8 hours per night and daily decompression rituals (walks, stretching, or breathing).

---

### 🧠 8. Relearn consistency
Regular eating is the antidote to the binge–restrict cycle.  
If you miss a meal, have something small — don’t skip entirely.

---

### ✅ Sample daily framework
**Breakfast:** 4 eggs + vegetables + coffee with cream  
**Pre-workout:** 1 banana  
**Post-workout:** High-protein yogurt + berries  
**Lunch/Dinner:** Protein + vegetables + healthy fats  
**Snack:** Nuts or sardines

### 💬 FAQ

<FAQ q="Is keto dangerous?" a="Not inherently, but long-term strict keto can cause nutrient and fiber deficiencies and may impair insulin sensitivity when carbs are reintroduced." />
<FAQ q="How fast should I lose weight?" a="A steady 0.4–0.7 kg per week preserves muscle and metabolism while encouraging fat loss." />
<FAQ q="Do I need to count every calorie?" a="Not necessarily. Focus on consistent meal structure, protein sufficiency, and avoiding extremes. Tracking can help short-term awareness." />
<FAQ q="What if I binge?" a="Return to structure at the next meal. Don’t restrict further — stability rebuilds balance faster than punishment." />
