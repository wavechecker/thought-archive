## Intro

The hepatitis B birth dose is a public-health “seatbelt”: most people never need it — until they do.

It exists because hepatitis B acquired at birth can silently become lifelong disease.

---

## Key Points

- Early hepatitis B infection is much more likely to become chronic than adult infection
- Chronic hepatitis B increases lifetime risk of severe liver disease
- Screening and follow-up help, but they can fail
- The birth dose provides early protection and redundancy

---

## Background

Hepatitis B is a liver infection. Many adults clear it. Infants often don’t.

The birth-dose strategy is designed to stop infection before it becomes lifelong.

---

## Why the birth dose was introduced

Before routine vaccination, perinatal transmission was a major pathway into chronic infection.

A universal birth dose was introduced in many settings because risk-based approaches miss edge cases.

## The “why” in one box

    "Newborn infection is far more likely to become chronic than adult infection",
    "Chronic infection can remain silent for decades",
    "Later consequences include cirrhosis and liver cancer",
    "The birth dose acts as a backstop when systems slip"

## When screening isn’t enough

Even good systems have failure modes:
- late/no prenatal care
- test or documentation errors
- unexpected deliveries
- follow-up gaps

A universal birth dose is designed for reality, not perfection.

## FAQ

**Q: Is the birth dose still recommended globally?**  
A: In many countries and in WHO guidance, yes — especially where prevalence is higher or system gaps exist.

**Q: Does delaying the first dose change the rest of the schedule?**  
A: It can, depending on national schedules. The key issue is the “unprotected window.”
