## Intro

Psychiatric disorders are typically diagnosed using symptom-based criteria. Large-scale genetic research increasingly shows that many conditions regarded as distinct in clinical practice share substantial **genetic risk architecture** and may converge on shared biological pathways.

This guide explains what cross-disorder genetic studies find, why this creates tension with traditional diagnostic systems, and what it may imply for diagnosis and treatment.

---

## Key Points

- Many psychiatric disorders share **polygenic** risk (many variants with small effects).
- A major cross-disorder analysis across **14 conditions** identified **five genomic factors** explaining ~**66%** of shared genetic liability.
- The DSM is **descriptive** (syndromes), while genetics begins to illuminate **mechanisms** (pathways, cell types).
- Comorbidity is expected when disorders share upstream vulnerabilities.
- These findings support **pathway-informed** research and treatment development, not immediate replacement of diagnostic categories.

---

## Background: What “Shared Genetics” Means

Most psychiatric conditions are influenced by many common genetic variants, each contributing a small amount of risk. A key complication is **pleiotropy**, where the same variant can influence multiple traits or diagnoses.

Shared genetics does not mean disorders are identical. It means:
- there can be common upstream vulnerabilities
- symptoms can diverge downstream due to development, environment, and other biological factors

---

## The Nature Cross-Disorder Study (14 Disorders)

A large international collaboration analyzed GWAS data spanning 14 disorders:

- ADHD
- Alcohol-use disorder
- Anorexia nervosa
- Anxiety disorders
- Autism spectrum disorder
- Bipolar disorder
- Cannabis-use disorder
- Major depressive disorder
- Nicotine dependence
- Obsessive-compulsive disorder
- Opioid-use disorder
- PTSD
- Schizophrenia
- Tourette syndrome

The authors report five underlying **genomic factors** capturing shared liability across disorders, along with hundreds of pleiotropic loci and pathway / cell-type enrichments.

---

## Five Genomic Factors

Instead of 14 fully distinct genetic signatures, disorders grouped into five broad dimensions:

1. **Schizophrenia + Bipolar (SB) factor**
2. **Internalizing factor** (major depression, PTSD, anxiety)
3. **Compulsive factor** (e.g., OCD, anorexia; with Tourette and anxiety loading more weakly)
4. **Neurodevelopmental factor** (autism, ADHD; with Tourette loading more weakly)
5. **Substance-use disorders (SUD) factor** (opioid, cannabis, alcohol, nicotine; with ADHD loading more weakly)

A key implication: within some clusters, the shared genetic signal is large and disorder-specific signal is relatively small.

---

## Descriptive vs Mechanistic Psychiatry

### DSM is descriptive

The DSM improves reliability by grouping symptom patterns into syndromes. It is designed to answer:
- What does this look like?
- How severe is it?
- How long has it lasted?

### Genetics is closer to mechanistic

Genetics begins to answer:
- Which pathways are implicated?
- Which cell types show enrichment?
- Why do diagnostic boundaries blur?

This helps explain why DSM categories may not map neatly onto biology, and why comorbidity is common.

---

## Implications for Diagnosis

These findings do not eliminate diagnoses. They suggest a complementary model:

- Diagnosis remains useful for communication, services, and treatment planning.
- Biology-informed dimensions may improve:
  - risk stratification
  - explanation of mixed presentations
  - identification of subtypes within a diagnosis

Over time, diagnostic systems may become more dimensional (e.g., internalizing vs compulsive vs psychotic-spectrum) rather than purely categorical.

---

## Implications for Treatment

### Why cross-diagnostic treatments can work

Some treatments already span disorders (e.g., SSRIs across depression/anxiety/OCD). Shared genetic and pathway signals provide a plausible biological rationale for why cross-diagnostic borrowing can be effective in subsets of patients.

### Pathway-informed development and repurposing

If clusters implicate specific biology (e.g., excitatory neuron enrichment in SB; oligodendrocyte biology in internalizing), this may guide:
- novel target discovery
- repurposing strategies
- mechanism-based trials that recruit by symptom domains or biomarkers rather than diagnosis alone

### “Treatment resistance” reframed

A useful clinical frame is that non-response can reflect:
- wrong target
- wrong mechanism assumption
rather than patient “complexity” alone.

---

## Limitations

- Large psychiatric GWAS are still uneven by ancestry; many analyses remain biased toward European-ancestry datasets.
- Individual variants have small effects; genetics is probabilistic, not deterministic.
- Mapping genes → pathways → symptoms remains incomplete.

---

## FAQ

**Q: Does this prove psychiatric diagnoses are wrong?**  
A: No. It shows diagnoses are descriptive syndromes that may not align cleanly with underlying biology.

**Q: Can I use genetic testing to pick the best medication today?**  
A: Not reliably. Current findings inform research and future stratification more than individual prescribing.

**Q: Why does this matter for patients?**  
A: It helps explain comorbidity, overlapping symptoms, and why treatments can work across labels in some people.
