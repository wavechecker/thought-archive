## Intro
**Antibiotic resistance** happens when germs adapt so medicines no longer work against them. Once easily treated infections can become harder — or sometimes impossible — to cure. This threatens modern medicine: surgeries, cancer therapy, and intensive care all rely on effective antibiotics.

## Key Points
- Antibiotic resistance is a global health crisis.  
- COVID-19 disrupted infection prevention and stewardship, driving new spikes in resistant infections.  
- Resistance spreads between people, animals, and the environment (a “One Health” problem).  
- Without stewardship, progress unravels quickly in times of stress.  

## Background
Antibiotics revolutionized medicine in the 20th century. Fleming himself warned that misuse would drive resistance. Today, resistant infections kill hundreds of thousands worldwide each year and make millions more harder to treat.

## Causes
- Overuse or misuse of antibiotics in people and animals  
- Poor infection control in healthcare settings  
- Global travel and trade spreading resistant strains  
- Few new antibiotics being developed  

## Diagnosis & Treatment
Labs culture germs and test them against drugs to guide treatment. Options shrink as resistance grows — sometimes leaving only toxic or less effective drugs.

## Risks & Prognosis
- Resistant infections last longer, cost more, and have higher death rates.  
- “Urgent threats” include CRE, *Candida auris*, and multidrug-resistant TB.  
- Without stewardship and prevention, the clock keeps ticking.  

## FAQ
**Q: Can resistance spread between people?**  
A: Yes. Resistant germs can pass via contact, contaminated surfaces, food, or water.  

**Q: Do vaccines help?**  
A: Yes. By preventing infections, vaccines reduce antibiotic use and slow resistance.  

**Q: What can individuals do?**  
A: Use antibiotics only when prescribed, finish the full course, stay up to date on vaccines, and practice hygiene.
