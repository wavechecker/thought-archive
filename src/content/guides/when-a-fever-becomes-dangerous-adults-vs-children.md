# When a Fever Becomes Dangerous: Adults vs Children

A fever is a temporary rise in body temperature, often a sign of infection — but some fevers require urgent care.

**Summary**  
The danger level depends on age, symptoms, and underlying health.

## Adults — seek urgent care if:
- Temp **>40°C (104°F)**  
- Confusion or difficulty breathing  
- Persistent vomiting  
- Severe headache or stiff neck  

## Children — seek urgent care if:
- Temp **>38°C (100.4°F)** in infants under 3 months  
- Persistent crying or irritability  
- Rash that doesn't fade when pressed  
- Seizures  

## Self-care for mild fevers
- Stay hydrated  
- Rest  
- Use fever-reducing medicine if uncomfortable (per instructions)  

### Fever-reducing medicines
- **Paracetamol (acetaminophen):** Safe for adults and children. Use if the fever is causing discomfort, aches, or trouble resting. Always follow the dosing on the package.  
- **Ibuprofen:** Can also reduce fever and ease pain. Suitable for adults and children over 6 months.  
  - Avoid in people with stomach ulcers, kidney problems, or certain heart conditions.  
  - Do not give to children with suspected **chickenpox** or **dehydration** unless advised by a doctor.  
- *Tip:* It's usually fine to use **either paracetamol or ibuprofen**, but alternating them isn't usually needed unless a doctor specifically recommends it.
