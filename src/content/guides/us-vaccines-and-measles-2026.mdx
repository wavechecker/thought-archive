## Introduction
This guide explains recent US vaccine policy changes and why measles is resurging — without political framing or advocacy.

---

## 1. What Changed in US Vaccine Guidance
Recent federal updates have:
- Reduced the number of vaccines labeled as “routine”
- Expanded shared decision-making language
- Shifted emphasis away from population-level framing

These changes affect **guidance language**, not vaccine safety, licensing, or effectiveness.

    "Vaccines themselves have not changed",
    "Safety data and approvals remain the same",
    "Clinical practice often differs from federal messaging"

## 2. Why Measles Is Central to This Discussion
Measles requires extremely high immunity levels to prevent spread.

Key characteristics:
- Airborne transmission
- Infectious before symptoms appear
- One case can infect many others rapidly

## 3. Denmark vs the United States
Denmark’s success depends on:
- High baseline vaccination coverage
- Consistent healthcare access
- Strong public trust in institutions

The US differs in population size, mobility, and coverage gaps — making measles outbreaks more likely when uptake declines.

---

## 4. What Has Not Changed
Despite policy debate:
- MMR remains highly effective
- Measles immunity thresholds remain unchanged
- Pediatric and infectious-disease societies continue routine recommendations
- State-level school requirements largely persist

---

## 5. Practical Guidance for Families
- Ensure measles immunity is up to date
- Pay attention to local outbreak reports
- Understand that “optional” does not equal “low risk”
- Adults unsure of immunity may require confirmation

---

## Summary
Measles is not responding to ideology or policy language.

It is responding to immunity gaps — exactly as expected.
