# Autism vs. ADHD: Understanding the Overlap

Parents often find themselves confused when trying to distinguish between **autism** and **ADHD**. Both can affect a child’s behavior, social life, and school performance.  
It’s also common for children to be diagnosed with **both conditions** — as many as 30–50% meet criteria for dual diagnosis.  

This guide explains the **differences**, the **areas of overlap**, and what parents should know when seeking support.  

---

## Why the Confusion?

- Both are **neurodevelopmental conditions** that begin in childhood.  
- Both can affect **attention, communication, and social skills**.  
- Both can make classroom settings especially challenging.  
- Both are increasingly recognized and diagnosed, sometimes together.  

---

## Core Differences

### Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)  
- Main features: differences in **social communication** and **restricted/repetitive behaviors**.  
- Children may struggle with eye contact, interpreting social cues, or adapting to changes in routine.  
- Sensory sensitivities are common.  
- Intense, focused interests are a hallmark trait.  

### Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)  
- Main features: **inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity**.  
- Children may have trouble sitting still, finishing tasks, or resisting distractions.  
- Impulsive behavior is central to ADHD.  
- Sensory differences are less pronounced than in autism.  

---

## Where They Overlap

- **Distractibility** – autistic children may tune out due to sensory overload; children with ADHD may lose focus due to impulsivity.  
- **Social struggles** – both may misread cues or interrupt conversations, but for different reasons.  
- **Emotional regulation difficulties** – frustration, meltdowns, or anxiety are common in both.  
- **Executive function challenges** – planning, organizing, and completing tasks can be difficult.  

---

## Why It Matters

- **Interventions differ**: ADHD may respond to stimulant medication, while autism supports focus on communication and sensory regulation.  
- **School strategies differ**: ADHD → redirection and activity breaks. Autism → structured routines and social supports.  
- **Family approaches differ**: Knowing which traits come from which condition helps parents respond effectively.  

---

## Supporting Kids with Both

- **Consistency** – clear rules, routines, and expectations.  
- **Balanced flexibility** – predictable environments, with gentle exposure to change.  
- **Strength-based approach** – building on interests, creativity, and unique abilities.  
- **Collaboration** – parents, teachers, and clinicians working together.

## Key Takeaway
