# Cancer — Guide Hub

Cancer is a group of diseases where abnormal cells grow uncontrollably and can spread to other parts of the body.  
This hub connects our condition-specific cancer guides, designed to support patients, families, and caregivers.

## Key Points
- Cancer is not a single disease but a group of related conditions.  
- Early detection and screening improve survival for many cancers.  
- Lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol, diet, sun exposure) play a major role in risk.  
- Treatment may involve surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, or a combination.  
- Supportive care is as important as treatment itself.
