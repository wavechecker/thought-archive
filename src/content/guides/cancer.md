# Cancer — Guide Hub

Cancer is a group of diseases where abnormal cells grow uncontrollably and can spread to other parts of the body.  
This hub connects our condition-specific cancer guides, designed to support patients, families, and caregivers.

## Cancer by the Numbers
- **10 million deaths** globally each year (WHO, 2024).  
- **19.3 million new cases** worldwide annually.  
- **Top cancers by incidence:** breast, lung, colorectal, prostate, and stomach.  
- **~30–50%** of cancers are preventable through lifestyle changes (tobacco, diet, alcohol, infection control).  
- **5-year survival rates** vary widely — >90% for early breast and prostate cancers, <20% for late-stage lung and liver cancers.  
- **1 in 5 people** worldwide will develop cancer in their lifetime.  

---

## Key Points
- Cancer is not a single disease but a group of related conditions.  
- Early detection and screening improve survival for many cancers.  
- Lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol, diet, sun exposure) play a major role in risk.  
- Treatment may involve surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, or a combination.  
- Supportive and palliative care are as important as treatment itself.
