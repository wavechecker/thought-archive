## Overview
Hepatitis B is a viral infection caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV), which attacks the liver and can cause both acute and chronic disease.  
Globally, nearly 300 million people live with chronic hepatitis B, making it one of the most significant infectious causes of death due to its link to cirrhosis and liver cancer.  

Unlike hepatitis A, which usually resolves on its own, hepatitis B can persist for life. Vaccination is the most effective tool to prevent infection.

## Key Points
- Transmitted through blood and bodily fluids (sex, birth, shared needles, medical exposure).  
- Can cause lifelong infection, cirrhosis, liver failure, and cancer.  
- The **hepatitis B vaccine** is highly effective and part of routine childhood immunization in most countries.  
- Antiviral medications can suppress the virus but usually cannot cure it.  
- Mother-to-child transmission at birth is a major source of new infections worldwide.

## Symptoms
Most acute infections cause few or no symptoms, but when present they may include:  
- Fatigue  
- Loss of appetite  
- Nausea and vomiting  
- Abdominal pain  
- Dark urine  
- Jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes)  

Chronic hepatitis B is often silent until advanced liver disease develops.

## Diagnosis
- **Blood tests** detect HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), antibodies, and viral DNA levels.  
- **Liver function tests** assess damage.  
- **Ultrasound or elastography** may be used to monitor for cirrhosis or liver cancer in chronic cases.  

---

## Treatment
- **Acute infection:** Usually supportive care; most adults clear the virus naturally.  
- **Chronic infection:** Treated with long-term antiviral medications (e.g., tenofovir, entecavir) to suppress viral replication and reduce complications.  
- **Liver transplant:** May be required for advanced cirrhosis or liver failure.  

There is currently no complete cure for chronic hepatitis B.  

---

## Prevention
- **Hepatitis B vaccine:**  
  - First given at birth, followed by 2â€“3 more doses in infancy.  
  - Provides >95% protection for life.  
- **Screening pregnant women** for HBV and giving antivirals if needed reduces mother-to-child transmission.  
- **Safe practices:** blood screening, sterile medical equipment, safe sex practices.

## Recent Developments
- WHO aims to eliminate hepatitis B as a public health threat by 2030 through universal vaccination and improved access to antiviral therapy.  
- Research is ongoing into curative therapies, including drugs that target the viral reservoir in liver cells.

## FAQ
**Q: Is hepatitis B curable?**  
A: Most adults clear the infection naturally if infected. Chronic cases can be controlled with medication, but a complete cure is not yet available.  

**Q: Can I get hepatitis B more than once?**  
A: No. Clearing the infection or being vaccinated provides lifelong immunity.  

**Q: Is the vaccine safe?**  
A: Yes. The hepatitis B vaccine has been used for decades and is highly safe and effective.
