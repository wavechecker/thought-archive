## Summary

Alzheimer’s disease is often discussed using two core pathologies:
- **Amyloid** (plaques)
- **Tau** (tangles)

They’re related — but not interchangeable.

This guide explains what each one is, what tests measure them, and why symptom onset doesn’t map perfectly to “how much plaque” alone.

## What is amyloid?

Amyloid (especially Aβ42) can aggregate into plaques. In many models, amyloid changes appear early—often before symptoms.

Tests that can reflect amyloid include:
- amyloid PET imaging
- cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ42 (and ratios)
- plasma Aβ42/40 (in some settings)

## What is tau?

Tau is a neuronal structural protein. In Alzheimer’s, tau becomes abnormally phosphorylated and can form tangles.

Tests that can reflect tau include:
- tau PET imaging
- CSF phosphorylated tau (p-tau)
- plasma p-tau biomarkers (including p-tau217)

Tau signals often track more closely with symptom severity than amyloid alone—especially once symptoms begin.

## Why both matter

A simplified mental model:
- amyloid is an early “pathology marker”
- tau often tracks closer to neurodegeneration and symptoms

But symptoms depend on more than biomarkers:
- brain resilience and age
- vascular disease
- other co-pathologies

## FAQ

### If amyloid is positive, does that mean I have dementia?

No. Amyloid positivity can occur years before symptoms and must be interpreted in a clinical context.

### Is tau a better predictor of symptoms than amyloid?

Tau biomarkers often correlate more closely with symptom severity than amyloid alone, especially around the time symptoms begin.

### Are amyloid and tau the only causes of cognitive decline?

No. Age-related changes, vascular disease, medications, depression, sleep problems, and other neurodegenerative diseases can also contribute.
