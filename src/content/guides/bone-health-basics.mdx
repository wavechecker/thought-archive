## Intro
Bones are living tissue. They grow, remodel, and repair themselves throughout life.  
Strong bones protect against fractures, support movement, and store minerals like calcium.

## Key Points
- Bones are constantly rebuilt by osteoblasts (build) and osteoclasts (break down).  
- Peak bone mass is reached in early adulthood; afterward, gradual loss begins.  
- Nutrition, hormones, and physical activity drive bone strength.  
- Prevention at any age lowers osteoporosis and fracture risk.

## How Bones Stay Strong
- **Remodeling:** balance between formation and resorption.  
- **Osteoblasts:** build new bone.  
- **Osteoclasts:** remove old bone.  
- **Osteocytes:** sense stress and guide repair.  
When this balance shifts (e.g., after menopause), bones become thinner and weaker.

## Risk Factors for Poor Bone Health
Age; menopause/low testosterone; family history; low calcium/vitamin D/protein; smoking; alcohol; inactivity; long-term steroids; chronic illness.

## How to Support Bone Health
**Nutrition:** calcium-rich foods, vitamin D, adequate protein.  
**Physical activity:** weight-bearing (walking, stairs), resistance training, balance/flexibility (tai chi, yoga).  
**Lifestyle:** avoid smoking, limit alcohol, maintain healthy weight, periodic screening if at risk.

## Prevention Across the Lifespan
- **Children & teens:** build peak bone mass via diet + activity.  
- **Adults:** maintain with nutrition and exercise.  
- **Older adults:** focus on fall prevention and medical management.

## FAQ
**Q: When do bones stop getting stronger?** Late 20s for most people.  
**Q: Do I need supplements?** Diet/sun first; supplement if intake is low (per clinician advice).  
**Q: Is walking enough?** Helpful, but adding strength training yields greater benefits.
