## Background
Anxiety disorders are characterized by excessive and uncontrollable fear, nervousness, or worry. They may be accompanied by physical symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, sweating, or dizziness. Left untreated, anxiety disorders can severely affect daily life, but treatment is often very effective.

- **Psychological:** trauma, maladaptive coping, perfectionism.  
- **Environmental:** chronic stress, social isolation, financial hardship.

## Diagnosis / Treatment / Options
### Talking therapies
- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** gold-standard treatment; helps challenge and change unhelpful thought patterns.  
- **Exposure therapy:** especially effective for phobias and panic disorder.  
- **Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT):** teaches mindfulness and acceptance strategies.  

### Medications
- **SSRIs and SNRIs:** first-line medications for many anxiety disorders.  
- **Benzodiazepines:** provide short-term relief but risk dependence; used cautiously.  
- **Beta-blockers:** helpful for physical symptoms like rapid heart rate.  

### Combined approach
Therapy and medication together can be more effective for moderate to severe cases.  

### Lifestyle interventions
- **Exercise:** reduces tension and boosts mood.  
- **Breathing and relaxation techniques:** meditation, yoga, progressive muscle relaxation.  
- **Sleep hygiene and nutrition:** strengthen resilience to stress.  

### Community and digital support
- **Peer groups:** provide reassurance and coping strategies.  
- **Digital CBT platforms:** expand access to therapy worldwide.
