**Rabies** is a viral infection of the nervous system that is **almost always fatal once symptoms appear**. The goal is prevention: **avoid exposures** and get **post‑exposure prophylaxis (PEP)** promptly after a bite or scratch.

## How rabies spreads
- **Bites or scratches** from infected mammals (dogs, bats, raccoons, foxes, cats, monkeys).
- Saliva contacting **broken skin** or **mucous membranes**.
- Not spread by casual contact.

## Higher‑risk regions (overview)
- **Africa & Asia:** Many countries have **endemic dog‑mediated rabies** and limited access to timely PEP.
- **Parts of Latin America:** Risk varies by country/region; some areas have made major progress, others remain higher risk.
- **Bats** can carry rabies **worldwide**, including in low dog‑rabies countries.

(Travellers should check up‑to‑date local guidance before departure.)

## Symptoms & incubation
- Incubation usually **1–3 months** (can be days to over a year).
- Early: fever, tingling at the bite site.  
- Later: **neurologic symptoms** (anxiety, agitation, difficulty swallowing, hydrophobia) → **coma**.

## What to do after a bite/scratch (urgent)
1. **Wash the wound immediately** with soap and running water for **15 minutes**; apply povidone‑iodine if available.
2. **Seek medical care ASAP** for **PEP**:
   - **Rabies vaccine series**.
   - **Rabies immunoglobulin (RIG)** for **category III** exposures (deep bites, mucous exposure), infiltrated around the wound.
3. **Do not delay** while arranging vaccines — time matters.

## Pre‑exposure vaccination (PrEP) — who should consider it
- Long stays or remote travel in **dog‑rabies endemic** countries.
- **Animal workers**, spelunkers, or bat researchers.
- PrEP **does not remove the need for PEP**; it simplifies it (no RIG; fewer doses).
