## Intro
Rabies is almost always **fatal** once symptoms begin — but it is **100% preventable** with prompt **post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)**. If you’re bitten or scratched by a potentially rabid animal (including bats), treat it as urgent.

## Key Points
- High-risk regions include parts of **Asia, Africa, and Latin America**; dogs are the main source globally.  
- **Any bite or scratch that breaks skin** (or saliva in eyes/mouth) needs **immediate wound washing** and **urgent medical care** for PEP.  
- **Bats:** even tiny, unseen bites can transmit rabies — if you wake to a bat in your room, seek PEP.  
- Pre-exposure vaccine simplifies PEP for frequent travelers or high-risk work, **but does not replace** PEP after an exposure.

## Before You Travel
- Check destination risk and consider **pre-exposure vaccination** if you’ll be in rural areas, around animals, or far from medical care.  
- Learn where to access **rabies vaccine** and **rabies immune globulin (RIG)** at your destination.

## If You’re Bitten or Scratched (Any Country)
1. **Wash the wound immediately** with soap and running water for **15 minutes**; irrigate thoroughly.  
2. Apply **povidone-iodine** or another antiseptic if available.  
3. **Seek medical care ASAP** for assessment and **PEP** (vaccine ± RIG).  
4. If safe to do so, get details about the animal (species, behavior, vaccination status) and inform local health authorities.

## Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)
- **Unvaccinated people:**  
  - **RIG**: infiltrate around the wound as much as possible on **Day 0**.  
  - **Vaccine**: doses on **Days 0, 3, 7, 14** (some regions add Day 28 for immunocompromised).  
- **Previously vaccinated (pre-exposure or prior full PEP):**  
  - **No RIG**.  
  - **Vaccine**: **Days 0 and 3**.  
> Start PEP **as soon as possible**; do **not** delay waiting for animal testing unless advised it’s safe.

## Which Exposures Need PEP?
- **Bites/scratches** that break skin.  
- **Saliva in eyes, mouth, or on broken skin.**  
- **Bat exposures** where a bite cannot be ruled out (asleep in a room with a bat, child/mentally impaired person with bat contact).  
- **Do not** generally need PEP for touching/feeding animals without bites/scratches or contact with blood/urine/feces/fur alone.

## Monitoring the Animal (When Feasible)
- Healthy **dogs/cats/ferrets** can sometimes be observed for **10 days**; if they remain healthy, transmission is unlikely.  
- Wildlife (bats, raccoons, foxes, stray dogs in high-risk areas) should be **treated as rabid until proven otherwise** — don’t delay PEP.

## Side Effects & Safety
- Rabies vaccines are well-tolerated (sore arm, mild fever).  
- RIG can cause local soreness; correct dosing and infiltration around the wound are important.  
- PEP is safe during **pregnancy** and in **children** — **do not** withhold.

## Prevention Tips While Traveling
- **Avoid contact** with dogs, cats, monkeys, and wildlife; don’t feed or pet animals.  
- Keep doors/windows screened; avoid sleeping where bats could enter.  
- Carry a small first-aid kit (soap/antiseptic) for immediate wound care.

## When to Seek Emergency Care
- **Any** bite/scratch from a mammal in a rabies-endemic area.  
- **Any bat exposure** where a bite can’t be ruled out.  
- Delayed access to vaccine/RIG — seek guidance on where to obtain them urgently.

## FAQ
**If I started PEP abroad, should I finish it at home?**  
Yes. Bring documentation; continue the schedule without restarting.

**What if RIG isn’t available on Day 0?**  
Start vaccine immediately; RIG can be given up to **Day 7** after the first vaccine.

**Do small scratches need PEP?**  
If they break skin, yes — especially in high-risk regions or with bats.
