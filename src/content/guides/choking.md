## Intro
Choking occurs when the airway is blocked by food or an object. Without quick action, choking can lead to unconsciousness and death within minutes. Knowing simple first aid steps can save a life.

## Key Points
- If the person can **cough, speak, or breathe**, encourage them to keep coughing.  
- If the airway is **completely blocked**, act immediately: back blows and abdominal thrusts (Heimlich maneuver).  
- Call emergency services if the obstruction is not quickly relieved.  
- Infant and child techniques differ from adults.  

## Recognizing Choking
- **Mild obstruction**: coughing forcefully, can breathe or speak.  
- **Severe obstruction**: unable to breathe, talk, or cough; clutching throat; silent struggle; turning blue.  

## First Aid for Adults and Children (Over 1 Year)
1. **Check** if they can cough or speak. If yes, encourage coughing.  
2. If not breathing or speaking:  
   - Deliver up to **5 back blows** between the shoulder blades.  
   - If still blocked, give **5 abdominal thrusts (Heimlich maneuver)**:  
     - Stand behind, wrap arms around waist.  
     - Make a fist just above the belly button, grasp with the other hand.  
     - Pull sharply inward and upward.  
   - Alternate back blows and abdominal thrusts until the object is expelled or the person becomes unresponsive.  
3. **Call emergency services** if obstruction persists.  
4. If the person becomes unresponsive, begin **CPR**.  

## First Aid for Infants (Under 1 Year)
1. Support the infant’s head and neck.  
2. Deliver **5 back blows** with the heel of your hand between the shoulder blades.  
3. If not relieved, turn the infant face-up and give **5 chest thrusts** (two fingers in the center of the chest, just below the nipple line).  
4. Alternate back blows and chest thrusts until the airway clears or help arrives.  
5. If unresponsive, start **infant CPR**.  

## Prevention
- Cut food into small pieces for children.  
- Keep small objects (coins, toys, batteries) out of reach.  
- Encourage eating slowly and not talking or laughing with food in the mouth.  
- Supervise children during meals and play.  

## FAQ
**Q: Should I try to grab the object from the mouth?**  
A: Only if it is clearly visible and easy to remove. Blind “sweeps” may push the object deeper.  

**Q: Can choking happen in sleep?**  
A: Rare, but aspiration can occur in people with medical conditions or impaired consciousness.  

**Q: Do abdominal thrusts hurt?**  
A: They may cause injury (e.g., bruising, cracked ribs), but saving the airway takes priority.
