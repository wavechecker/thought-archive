## Intro
Falls are a leading cause of injury in older adults. When bones are weakened by osteoporosis, even minor falls can result in serious fractures — especially of the hip, wrist, and spine.

## Key Points
- Falls are the most common cause of fractures in older adults.  
- Hip and spine fractures carry the highest risks of disability and death.  
- Prevention strategies reduce both falls and fracture risk.  
- Prompt treatment of fractures improves recovery and independence.  

## Causes and Risk Factors
- **Bone weakness:** osteoporosis or osteopenia.  
- **Balance and mobility issues:** weakness, nerve disorders, poor footwear.  
- **Vision/hearing loss:** harder to detect hazards.  
- **Medications:** sedatives, BP drugs, anything causing dizziness.  
- **Environment:** loose rugs, clutter, poor lighting.  

## Common Fracture Sites
- Hip (femoral neck)  
- Spine (vertebrae)  
- Wrist/forearm  
- Shoulder, ankle, pelvis  

## Prevention
- **Exercise:** weight-bearing, strength training, balance exercises (tai chi, yoga).  
- **Home safety:** remove hazards, add grab bars, improve lighting.  
- **Vision checks** and updated glasses.  
- **Medication review:** reduce sedatives.  
- **Support devices:** canes, walkers, hip protectors.  

## Treatment
- **Fracture care:** casting, surgery, pain control, PT.  
- **Rehabilitation:** restores strength and mobility.  
- **Bone health:** address osteoporosis with medication and supplements.  

## FAQ
**Q: What should I do if someone falls?**  
A: If they can’t move or suspect fracture → call emergency services.  

**Q: Are all fractures preventable?**  
A: No, but many can be avoided with strong bones + fall prevention.
