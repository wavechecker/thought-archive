## Overview
Skin cancer is usually confirmed with a **biopsy** after a suspicious spot is found.  
Treatment depends on the **type and stage** — most cases are cured with surgery, but advanced melanomas may require immunotherapy or targeted drugs.

---

## Skin Cancer by the Numbers
- **1 in 3 cancers diagnosed** globally is a skin cancer (WHO).  
- **>2 million non-melanoma cases** (basal & squamous cell) diagnosed worldwide every year.  
- **Melanoma** makes up a minority of cases but causes the majority of skin cancer deaths.  
- **90% of skin cancers** are linked to UV exposure.  
- **Surgery cure rates:** >95% for basal and squamous cell cancers when caught early.  
- **Melanoma survival:** >95% if detected early, but <30% once spread to distant sites.  

---

## Key Points
- **Diagnosis** relies on skin exams, dermoscopy, and biopsy.  
- **Staging** determines whether cancer has spread and guides treatment.  
- **Surgery** is the main treatment for most skin cancers.  
- **Mohs surgery** is highly effective for facial or recurrent cancers.  
- **Radiotherapy** and **topical creams** are used in selected cases.  
- **Immunotherapy and targeted therapy** are used for advanced melanoma.

## Diagnosis
1. **Skin Exam:** Doctor checks for suspicious spots or moles.  
2. **Dermoscopy:** Magnified light exam improves detection accuracy.  
3. **Biopsy:** Excision, shave, or punch biopsy confirms diagnosis.  
4. **Staging Tests:** Ultrasound, CT, MRI, or sentinel lymph node biopsy may be done if spread is suspected.  

---

## Treatment Options
### 1. Surgery
- **Excision:** Standard removal of cancer with a safety margin.  
- **Mohs Surgery:** Layer-by-layer removal, examining each under a microscope, ideal for face or recurrent cancers.  

### 2. Topical Therapy
- **5-FU or imiquimod creams** may treat superficial cancers.  

### 3. Radiotherapy
- External beam radiation used when surgery isn’t feasible or for recurrence.  

### 4. Systemic Therapy (Advanced Melanoma)
- **Immunotherapy:** Checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., anti-PD-1 drugs).  
- **Targeted Therapy:** BRAF/MEK inhibitors if tumor has mutations.

## FAQ
**Q: How is skin cancer diagnosed?**  
A: Through a skin exam, dermoscopy, and confirmed by biopsy.  

**Q: What is Mohs surgery?**  
A: A surgical technique that removes cancer layer by layer, minimizing healthy tissue loss.  

**Q: When is radiotherapy used?**  
A: If surgery isn’t possible, or as additional treatment for advanced/recurrent cases.  

**Q: What treatments are used for melanoma?**  
A: Surgery for early stages, immunotherapy and targeted therapy for advanced disease.
