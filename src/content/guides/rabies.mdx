## Intro
Rabies is a viral disease that attacks the brain and spinal cord. Once symptoms appear, it is nearly always **fatal** — but it is **100% preventable** with prompt vaccination after exposure.

<Aside title="PEP Emergency Checklist" variant="warning">
**If bitten/scratched or there’s a possible bat exposure:**
1) **Wash** the wound immediately with soap & running water for **15 min** (irrigate well).  
2) Apply **antiseptic** (e.g., povidone-iodine) if available.  
3) **Seek urgent care** for **PEP** — do **not** wait for symptoms.  
4) If safe, arrange testing/observation of the animal via local health authorities.  
**Previously vaccinated?** You still need vaccines (Days 0 & 3) — **no RIG**.  
**Unvaccinated?** You need **RIG on Day 0** + vaccines on **Days 0, 3, 7, 14** (add Day 28 if immunocompromised).
</Aside>

While rabies is rare in the United States, it causes an estimated **60,000 deaths** worldwide each year, mainly in Africa and Asia. Bats are the leading source of human rabies in the U.S., while dogs account for most deaths globally.

## Key Points
- **Cause:** Rabies virus (*Lyssavirus*, family *Rhabdoviridae*).  
- **Transmission:** Saliva from infected animals via **bites**; also scratches or saliva contacting eyes, mouth, or broken skin.  
- **Reservoirs:** Globally **dogs**; in the U.S., **bats**; also raccoons, foxes, skunks, coyotes.  
- **Fatality:** Nearly 100% once symptoms start — prevention with **PEP** is critical.  
- **PEP basics:** Immediate wound cleaning → rabies immune globulin (if never vaccinated) → vaccine series.  

## Transmission & Risk
- **Animals:** Dogs (global), bats (U.S.), raccoons, foxes, skunks, coyotes.  
- **Higher risk groups:** Travelers to endemic regions, veterinarians, animal control/wildlife workers, lab staff handling the virus, cavers/spelunkers, and young children in dog-rabies regions.

<Aside title="Bat Exposures (Treat as Possible Exposure)" variant="info">
If you **wake to a bat in the room**, or a child/cognitively impaired person has bat contact where a bite **cannot** be ruled out, seek **PEP assessment immediately** — even without a visible bite.
</Aside>

## Symptoms
- **Incubation (weeks–months):** Usually no symptoms.  
- **Early:** Fever, headache, malaise, tingling/prickling or pain at the bite site.  
- **Progressive:** Agitation, confusion, hallucinations, aggressive behavior; **hydrophobia** and excessive saliva are classic.  
- **Outcome:** Rapid progression to coma and death within days to weeks.

## Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)
**Not previously vaccinated**
- **RIG:** Infiltrate around/into the wound on **Day 0** (as much as anatomically feasible).  
- **Vaccine:** **Days 0, 3, 7, 14**. (Immunocompromised: add **Day 28**.)  

**Previously vaccinated (PrEP or prior full PEP)**
- **No RIG.**  
- **Vaccine:** **Days 0 and 3**.

> Start PEP **as soon as possible**. Don’t delay for animal testing unless public health authorities confirm it’s safe.

## Which Exposures Need PEP?
- **Bites/scratches** that break the skin.  
- **Saliva** contacting eyes, mouth, or broken skin.  
- **Bat scenarios** where a bite cannot be ruled out.  
- **Usually not PEP:** Touching/feeding animals without a bite/scratch; contact with blood/urine/feces/fur alone.

## Monitoring Animals (When Feasible)
- Healthy **dogs/cats/ferrets** may be observed for **10 days**; if they remain healthy, transmission is unlikely.  
- **Wildlife** (bats, raccoons, foxes, skunks; stray dogs in high-risk areas) should be considered **rabid until proven otherwise** — do **not** delay PEP.

## Travel Risks & Pre-Exposure Vaccine (PrEP)
- **Higher risk regions:** Many parts of **Asia, Africa, Latin America** (dog rabies).  
- **Consider PrEP** (2 doses, 7 days apart) if you’ll be in rural/remote areas, around animals, or far from reliable medical care.  
- **Know access points** for rabies vaccine and RIG at your destination.

## Prevention
- Keep **pets up to date** on rabies vaccination.  
- Avoid contact with **stray animals** and wildlife; teach children not to touch unfamiliar animals.  
- **Bat-proof** sleeping areas (screens, seal gaps, chimneys).  
- Travelers: don’t feed or pet animals; carry a small **first-aid kit** for immediate wound care.

## Safety & Side Effects
- Rabies vaccines are **safe** in adults, children, and during **pregnancy**.  
- Common effects: sore arm, mild fever.  
- RIG may cause local discomfort but is essential for the **unvaccinated**.

## FAQ
**Do small scratches need PEP?**  
Yes—if they break the skin, especially with high-risk species or in endemic areas.

**What if I started PEP abroad?**  
Bring documentation and complete the schedule at home without restarting.

**What if RIG isn’t available on Day 0?**  
Begin vaccine immediately; **RIG can be administered up to Day 7** after the first dose.

**Can rabies be cured after symptoms start?**  
No. Prevention with timely PEP is the only reliable protection.
