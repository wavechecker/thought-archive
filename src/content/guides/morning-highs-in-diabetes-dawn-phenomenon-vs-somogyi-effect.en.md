# Morning Highs in Diabetes — Dawn Phenomenon vs Somogyi Effect

Morning Highs in Diabetes — Dawn Phenomenon vs Somogyi Effect
Overview

Some people wake up with high blood sugar. Two main causes: Dawn phenomenon (normal hormone surge) and Somogyi effect (rebound from overnight hypo).

Key Symptoms

Morning blood glucose higher than bedtime

Sometimes night sweats or disturbed sleep (if overnight hypo)

Causes / Risk Factors

Natural 3–8am hormone rise (cortisol, growth hormone)

Too much evening insulin causing night-time hypo → rebound high

What To Do Now

Test at 2–3am:

High → Dawn phenomenon

Low → Somogyi effect

Adjust evening insulin or snacks with doctor guidance

Diagnosis & Treatment

Continuous glucose monitoring is most accurate

Doctor may adjust timing/type of insulin

Prevention / Daily Management

Avoid late heavy carb snacks

Consistent sleep routine

Regular review of insulin regimen

Red-Flag Signs

Repeated severe morning highs (>15 mmol/L / >270 mg/dL)

Night-time hypos with confusion or seizures
