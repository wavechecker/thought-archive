# Understanding Coronary Angiography

**Coronary angiography** is a special X-ray test that uses contrast dye to show the arteries supplying blood to your heart. It is one of the main tools for detecting blockages or narrowing that may cause chest pain, heart attack, or other heart problems.

---

## When it's used

Doctors may recommend angiography if you have:

- Chest pain or **angina** not fully explained by other tests  
- A **heart attack** or suspicion of one  
- Abnormal results on an **ECG, stress test, or echocardiogram**  
- Known heart disease that needs re-evaluation  

---

## How the procedure works

1. **Access point** — A thin, flexible tube (catheter) is inserted into an artery, usually in your **wrist (radial artery)** or **groin (femoral artery)**.  
2. **Contrast dye** — A special iodine dye is injected to make blood vessels visible on X-ray.  
3. **X-ray imaging** — The cardiologist views real-time images (angiograms) to look for narrowed or blocked arteries.  
4. **Next steps** — Depending on findings, treatment may involve medication, **angioplasty with stent**, or **bypass surgery**.

---

## Preparation

- **Fasting** — usually no food or drink for 6–8 hours before  
- **Medications** — your doctor may adjust blood thinners, diabetes medicines, or ask you to take aspirin  
- **Allergies** — tell your team if you've had a reaction to contrast dye, iodine, or shellfish  

---

## Recovery

- You'll rest in a recovery area for a few hours.  
- Most people go home the same day (if stable).  
- Avoid heavy lifting or strenuous activity for 1–2 days, especially if the groin was used.  
- Watch for bleeding, swelling, or unusual pain at the catheter site.  

---

## Risks (uncommon)

- Bleeding or bruising where the catheter was inserted  
- Allergic reaction to dye  
- Kidney strain from the contrast dye (higher risk if you already have kidney problems)  
- Rare complications like stroke, heart attack, or arrhythmia
