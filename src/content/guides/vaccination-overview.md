# Vaccination Overview

## Intro
Vaccination is one of the most important public health achievements in history. By training the immune system to recognize and fight infections, vaccines have prevented millions of deaths and helped eradicate or control deadly diseases like smallpox, polio, and measles.  

This section brings together guides on how vaccines work, their safety, and the policies that shape vaccination globally.

## Key Points
- Vaccines mimic infection safely, building immunity without disease.  
- Adjuvants, like aluminum salts, boost responses when needed.  
- Surveillance systems worldwide continuously monitor vaccine safety.  
- Myths, such as a link between vaccines and autism, have been repeatedly debunked.  
- Vaccine hesitancy remains a challenge, underscoring the need for trust and clear communication.
