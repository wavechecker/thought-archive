## What this is (plain language)
In type 2 diabetes, the body can still make insulin but does not use it well. Sugar builds up in the blood and can harm organs over time.

## Daily self-care (do this)
- Check blood sugar as advised.
- Take medicines exactly as prescribed (pills or injections).
- Base meals around vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains.
- Move most days (aim about 150 minutes per week).
- Care for feet daily; report wounds or numbness.

## Do not do this
- Do not skip medicines or double dose without advice.
- Do not ignore very high or very low readings or red flag symptoms.

## Red flag symptoms (urgent care)
- Vomiting, confusion, severe drowsiness, trouble breathing.
- Blood sugar far above your target and not coming down.

## Common medicines (know the basics)
Metformin, GLP-1 receptor agonists (for example, semaglutide), SGLT2 inhibitors (for example, empagliflozin), insulin. Ask about side effects like nausea, dehydration, or low sugar.
