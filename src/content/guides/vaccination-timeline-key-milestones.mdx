## Intro

Vaccination isn’t one story — it’s a long chain of system design, trust, logistics, and biology.

Here are the milestones that still shape policy today.

## Key Points

- Vaccination success depends as much on **systems** as on science
- “Universal” schedules often exist to compensate for **real-world gaps**
- Birth-dose policies are usually about **redundancy**, not fear

## Timeline

- **1796** — Early smallpox inoculation work becomes a prototype for vaccination.
- **1955** — Polio vaccine era begins; mass campaigns become a modern template.
- **1960s–1970s** — Global scale-up: measles programs expand and routine childhood schedules consolidate.
- **1980** — Smallpox eradication declared; vaccination becomes a proof-of-concept for elimination.
- **1991** — Universal infant hepatitis B vaccination becomes a major strategy in settings prioritising perinatal prevention.
- **2000s** — Wider use of combination vaccines and schedule optimisation.
- **2020s** — Trust, misinformation, and politicisation become central constraints in high-income countries.
