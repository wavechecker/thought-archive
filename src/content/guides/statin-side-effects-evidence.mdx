## Intro

Statins are among the most widely prescribed drugs in the world — and among the most feared.

This guide summarises the highest-quality evidence available on statin side effects, based on the largest randomized safety analysis ever published.

---

## Key Points

- Most listed statin side effects are **not supported by randomized evidence**
- Mild liver enzyme changes are real but rarely clinically serious
- Muscle symptoms and diabetes risk are genuine but modest
- Cardiovascular benefits overwhelmingly exceed proven harms

---

## Background

Many statin side effects entered drug labels through observational studies, case reports, and spontaneous reporting systems.

These data sources are vulnerable to expectation bias and cannot reliably establish causality.

## Supported adverse effects

### Liver enzyme elevations
- Dose-dependent increases in ALT and AST
- Rarely associated with clinically meaningful liver injury

### Muscle symptoms
- Small real increase, mostly within the first year of therapy
- Severe myopathy remains rare

### Diabetes
- Modest increase in diagnosis
- Primarily affects individuals already near diagnostic thresholds

---

## Adverse effects *not* supported by evidence

Randomized, double-blind trials show **no causal association** between statins and:

- Cognitive impairment or memory loss  
- Dementia or Alzheimer’s disease  
- Depression  
- Sleep disturbance  
- Sexual dysfunction  
- Kidney failure  
- Lung disease  
- Cancer

## FAQ

**Do statins cause memory loss?**  
No. Large blinded randomized trials show no increase in cognitive impairment.

**Should liver function be monitored on statins?**  
Yes. Mild enzyme elevations can occur, but serious liver injury is rare.

**Why are these side effects still listed on drug labels?**  
Many were added based on low-quality evidence and have not been formally revised.
