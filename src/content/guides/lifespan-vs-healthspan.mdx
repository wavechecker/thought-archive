## Intro

Most people who talk about “longevity” actually want more **good years**, not just more years. That’s healthspan.

## Key Points

- Lifespan = total years lived
- Healthspan = years lived in good function
- Many interventions aim at **compression of morbidity**
- Improving healthspan can be valuable even without adding years

## Background

*Stub: expand with examples (BP control, exercise, vaccination, smoking cessation).*

## FAQ

**Q: What is healthspan?**  
A: The portion of life spent in good health and function.

**Q: What is compression of morbidity?**  
A: Delaying disease so ill-health occupies a shorter period near end of life.

**Q: Can healthspan improve without changing lifespan?**  
A: Yes — often.
