## Intro

This guide will grade longevity interventions by the quality of evidence and the magnitude of plausible benefit.

## Key Points

- “Longevity” often means **disease prevention + functional maintenance**
- Evidence is strongest for: exercise, BP control, smoking cessation, vaccines, metabolic risk control
- Supplements and “biohacks” often have weaker human evidence

## Evidence buckets (stub)

- **Strong**: exercise, BP control, smoking cessation
- **Moderate**: sleep optimization, diet quality patterns
- **Unclear/experimental**: many supplements, off-label longevity drugs

## FAQ

**Q: What has the best evidence for healthspan?**  
A: Foundational prevention: exercise, BP control, smoking cessation, vaccines, metabolic risk reduction.

**Q: Do supplements extend lifespan?**  
A: Usually limited evidence in humans; benefits often relate to deficiencies.
