# Light Therapy and Circadian Health

*[← Back to Toolkit](/guides/mental-health-toolkit)*

Light is one of the most powerful regulators of mood and body rhythms. Bright light therapy helps combat **seasonal affective disorder (SAD)** and improves circadian alignment.  

---

## How It Works

- Human body clocks run slightly longer than 24 hours  
- Morning light **resets the circadian rhythm**  
- Bright light suppresses melatonin, boosting alertness  

---

## Using Light Therapy

- Choose a light box emitting **10,000 lux**  
- Sit about **30 minutes each morning**  
- Position it at a downward angle toward the eyes (avoid direct glare)  
- Adjust session time: increase if no benefit, reduce if jittery  

---

## Research Highlights

- Improves SAD symptoms within **1–2 weeks**  
- Comparable effect to antidepressants in some trials  
- May also help with non-seasonal depression and sleep disorders
