## Intro
Depression is one of the most common mental health conditions worldwide, affecting an estimated **300 million people**. It is more than sadness—it is a persistent condition that can impair daily functioning, relationships, and overall health. The good news: depression is treatable, and most people recover with the right support.

## Background
Depression (major depressive disorder) is a mood disorder characterized by persistent low mood and loss of interest in activities. It can range from mild to severe, and may be episodic or chronic. Stigma often prevents people from seeking help, but effective treatments are widely available.

## Causes or Mechanisms
- **Biological:** genetics, neurotransmitter imbalance, hormonal changes, chronic illness.  
- **Psychological:** trauma, chronic stress, negative thought patterns.  
- **Social:** isolation, poverty, major life changes, lack of support networks.

## Diagnosis / Treatment / Options
### Talking therapies
- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** helps reframe negative thought patterns and build coping skills.  
- **Interpersonal Therapy (IPT):** focuses on relationships, grief, and role transitions.  
- **Behavioral Activation:** encourages re-engagement with rewarding activities.  

### Medications
- **Antidepressants (SSRIs, SNRIs, tricyclics):** correct chemical imbalances in the brain.  
- **Tailored prescribing:** chosen based on individual needs, side effect profiles, and co-existing conditions.  

### Combined approach
Evidence shows that **therapy + medication together** is often more effective than either alone, particularly for moderate to severe depression.  

### Lifestyle interventions
- **Exercise:** regular activity improves mood and reduces symptoms.  
- **Sleep hygiene:** consistent, restorative sleep helps regulate mood.  
- **Nutrition:** balanced diet supports overall brain health.  
- **Mindfulness & meditation:** reduce stress and improve emotional regulation.  

### Social and community support
- **Peer support groups:** provide connection and shared experience.  
- **Family education:** helps reduce stigma and strengthen recovery networks.  
- **Workplace accommodations:** flexible scheduling, reduced stigma in professional settings.  

### New and emerging treatments
- **Digital therapies:** online CBT and mobile apps expand access.  
- **Brain stimulation therapies:** such as ECT (electroconvulsive therapy) or TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation) for treatment-resistant cases.  
- **Novel research:** ketamine and psychedelic-assisted therapies are being studied, with early evidence of benefit in some treatment-resistant cases.

## Risks / Benefits / Prognosis
- **Untreated risks:** disability, physical health decline, suicide.  
- **Benefits of treatment:** restored energy, improved relationships, return to work or school, and better long-term health.  
- **Prognosis:** Most people improve significantly with treatment. Even when depression recurs, prior experience with therapy or medication often helps speed recovery.
