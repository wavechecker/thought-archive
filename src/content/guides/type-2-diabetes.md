# Type 2 Diabetes — Guide Hub

Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes worldwide. It occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or does not produce enough, leading to rising blood sugar levels over time. Unlike type 1, type 2 often develops gradually and can sometimes be prevented or delayed.

## Key Points
- Accounts for **90%+ of all diabetes cases**.  
- Usually develops in adults, but increasingly seen in children and teens.  
- Strongly linked to **obesity, diet, and inactivity**, but genetics also play a role.  
- Starts with **prediabetes** in many cases.  
- Lifestyle changes, weight management, and medications can prevent complications.  

## Symptoms
- Increased thirst and urination  
- Fatigue  
- Blurred vision  
- Slow-healing wounds  
- Tingling or numbness in hands/feet  
- Sometimes no symptoms in early stages  

## Risk Factors
- Overweight/obesity (especially abdominal)  
- Sedentary lifestyle  
- Family history of diabetes  
- Age over 45  
- History of gestational diabetes  
- Certain ethnic backgrounds (South Asian, Pacific Islander, Hispanic, African ancestry)  

## Management
- **Lifestyle changes**: balanced diet, physical activity (150+ mins/week), weight management.  
- **Medications**: metformin often first-line; others may be added.  
- **Insulin**: required if oral medications and injectables aren’t enough.  
- **Monitoring**: blood sugar, HbA1c, and screening for complications.  

## Complications
If unmanaged, type 2 diabetes increases risk of:  
- Heart attack and stroke  
- Kidney disease (nephropathy)  
- Nerve damage (neuropathy)  
- Eye disease (retinopathy)  
- Foot ulcers and infections

## FAQ
**Q: Can type 2 diabetes be reversed?**  
A: Some people can return to normal blood sugar with sustained weight loss and lifestyle changes, but monitoring remains essential.  

**Q: How is type 2 different from type 1?**  
A: Type 1 is autoimmune and requires insulin from diagnosis. Type 2 is linked to insulin resistance and may be managed without insulin initially.  

**Q: Can children get type 2 diabetes?**  
A: Yes. Rates are increasing in children and teens due to obesity, poor diet, and inactivity.  

**Q: What’s the role of prediabetes?**  
A: Prediabetes is a warning stage where blood sugar is elevated but not yet diabetes. Many people with prediabetes can prevent or delay type 2 with lifestyle changes.
