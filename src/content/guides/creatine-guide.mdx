## Intro
Creatine is one of the most researched and effective supplements for improving strength, muscle mass, and metabolic health. Originally popular among athletes, it now shows benefits for older adults, people with obesity, and those managing chronic metabolic conditions.

## Key Points
- Boosts muscle energy and training capacity  
- Supports lean mass and fat loss through improved performance  
- May improve insulin sensitivity and cognition  
- Safe long-term at 3–5 g/day (creatine monohydrate)  

## Background
Creatine stores high-energy phosphate groups in the form of phosphocreatine. This helps regenerate ATP, the body’s energy currency, during short bursts of intense activity. Supplementation increases these stores, improving output and recovery.

## Mechanism
- **ATP resynthesis:** speeds energy regeneration  
- **Muscle hypertrophy:** greater training volume → lean growth  
- **Metabolic effects:** improved glucose handling, mitochondrial function  
- **Neurological benefits:** supports brain phosphocreatine levels  

## Dosage and Use
**Loading phase:** 20 g/day for 5–7 days (split doses)  
**Maintenance:** 3–5 g/day thereafter  

Alternatively, 3–5 g daily without loading achieves full saturation in about four weeks.  

Best taken with carbohydrates or protein post-workout. Dissolve in warm water or mix with yogurt or smoothies. Consistency matters more than timing.

## Safety and Side Effects
Creatine is one of the safest known ergogenic aids.  
- **Common:** transient water retention, mild GI upset if taken dry.  
- **Rare:** cramps or bloating — reduce dose or increase hydration.  

No evidence of liver or kidney toxicity in healthy users for up to five years of continuous use.

## Risks / Benefits / Prognosis
**Benefits:**  
- Improved strength and power  
- Better metabolic health  
- Possible cognitive protection  

**Risks:**  
- None serious in healthy adults  

**Prognosis:**  
Consistent use contributes to better metabolic resilience and muscle preservation with age.

## FAQ
**Q: Is creatine helpful for fat loss?**  
A: Indirectly — by increasing muscle mass and training output, it improves metabolic rate and body composition.  

**Q: Can I take creatine with caffeine?**  
A: Yes. No evidence suggests negative interaction at normal doses.  

**Q: Is micronized creatine better?**  
A: Only for solubility; physiological effects are identical.  

**Q: Can vegetarians benefit more from creatine?**  
A: Yes — plant-based diets provide less dietary creatine, so supplementation often produces greater gains.
