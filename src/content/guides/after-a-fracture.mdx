## Intro
A hip fracture or other low-impact fracture is often the first clear sign of osteoporosis.  
While surgery and rehabilitation repair the break, it’s just as important to treat the underlying bone weakness to prevent future fractures.

## Key Points
- A fracture after a minor fall usually means bones are fragile from osteoporosis.  
- Rehab restores movement and independence, but bone treatment reduces the chance of another fracture.  
- Medications, exercise, nutrition, and fall prevention are all part of long-term management.  

## Recovery After Fracture
- **Rehabilitation:** physical therapy for strength, balance, walking confidence.  
- **Pain management:** medication, heat/ice, support devices.  
- **Mobility aids:** canes, walkers, hip protectors.  
- **Home safety:** remove hazards, install grab bars, improve lighting.  

## Tackling Osteoporosis
- **Medical assessment:** DEXA scan and lab tests.  
- **Medications:** bisphosphonates, denosumab, or anabolic agents.  
- **Nutrition:** calcium + vitamin D.  
- **Exercise:** once cleared, weight-bearing + resistance training.  

## Why It Matters
- After a hip fracture, the risk of a second fracture is high.  
- Treating osteoporosis reduces that risk and helps maintain independence.  
- Early secondary prevention is key: every fracture is a chance to intervene.  

## FAQ
**Q: Do all fractures mean osteoporosis?**  
A: Not always, but hip and spine fractures after minor falls are highly suggestive.  

**Q: When should osteoporosis treatment start?**  
A: As soon as the fracture is stabilized — rehab and bone health should go hand-in-hand.  

**Q: What if I’m already on treatment?**  
A: Your doctor may review or adjust medication for maximum protection.
