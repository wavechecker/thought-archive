## Intro
Heart palpitations are the sensation of your heart racing, pounding, skipping beats, or fluttering. They are common and often harmless, but in some cases they may signal a heart rhythm problem that requires medical attention.

## Key Points
- Palpitations are usually caused by anxiety, caffeine, or stimulants.  
- They can also be linked to thyroid problems, anemia, or heart rhythm disorders.  
- Simple tests like an ECG or Holter monitor can help find the cause.  
- Most cases are harmless and improve with lifestyle changes.  

## ðŸš¨ Red Flags
Seek urgent medical help if palpitations occur with:  
- Chest pain or pressure  
- Fainting or near-fainting  
- Severe shortness of breath  
- Dizziness or confusion  
- Palpitations lasting longer than a few minutes without relief  

## âœ… Reassurance
- Most palpitations are **benign and self-limiting**.  
- They often come from everyday triggers like stress, caffeine, or lack of sleep.  
- If you are otherwise healthy, palpitations are rarely dangerous.  

## Background
Your heartbeat is controlled by the heartâ€™s electrical system. Anything that alters this rhythm â€” from stress hormones to caffeine to structural heart disease â€” can cause palpitations. Most people experience them at some point in their lives.

## Causes or Risk Factors
- **Lifestyle/benign:** stress, anxiety, caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, dehydration, lack of sleep.  
- **Medical conditions:** thyroid disease, anemia, pregnancy, fever, electrolyte imbalance.  
- **Heart rhythm disorders:** atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), ventricular arrhythmias.  
- **Medications and substances:** decongestants, asthma inhalers, stimulants, recreational drugs.  

## Diagnosis and Treatment
- **Initial evaluation:** history, physical exam, and ECG.  
- **Monitoring:** Holter (24â€“48h) or event monitors to catch intermittent episodes.  
- **Blood tests:** thyroid, blood count, electrolytes.  
- **Treatment:** depends on cause. For most people, reducing triggers (caffeine, stress, alcohol) is enough.  
- **Serious arrhythmias:** may need medications, procedures (ablation), or devices (pacemaker/defibrillator).  

## Risks and Prognosis
- Most palpitations are harmless.  
- Risk rises if associated with heart disease, family history of sudden cardiac death, or abnormal ECG.  
- With proper diagnosis, most rhythm disorders can be well controlled.  

## FAQ
**Q: Should I see a doctor if my heart races during exercise?**  
A: A faster heartbeat during exertion is normal. If it feels irregular, causes chest pain, or makes you faint, see a doctor.  

**Q: Can anxiety really cause palpitations?**  
A: Yes. Stress hormones trigger the heart to beat faster and stronger. This is one of the most common causes.  

**Q: What tests should I expect?**  
A: Usually an ECG first, sometimes a Holter monitor, blood tests, and rarely an echocardiogram.  

**Q: Are palpitations dangerous in young healthy people?**  
A: Usually not. They are often due to lifestyle triggers and resolve with reassurance and lifestyle changes.
