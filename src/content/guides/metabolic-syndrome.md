## Intro
Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions — high blood pressure, high blood sugar, abnormal cholesterol, and excess waist fat — that together raise the risk of heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes.

## Key Points
- Defined by the presence of 3 or more risk factors: high waist circumference, high blood pressure, high fasting glucose, high triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol.  
- Strongly associated with insulin resistance and central obesity.  
- Lifestyle changes can significantly reduce risk.  

## Background
Metabolic syndrome affects up to one in three adults in some countries. It reflects an underlying imbalance in metabolism, often driven by excess visceral fat, poor diet, and inactivity.  

## Causes or Mechanisms
- **Central obesity**: visceral fat drives inflammation and insulin resistance.  
- **Insulin resistance**: cells respond poorly to insulin, raising blood sugar.  
- **Genetics**: family history of type 2 diabetes and heart disease raises risk.  
- **Lifestyle**: high-calorie diets, sedentary behavior, smoking, and stress.  

## Diagnosis / Treatment
**Diagnosis (NCEP ATP III criteria):** at least 3 of the following:  
- Waist circumference >102 cm (men) or >88 cm (women).  
- Blood pressure ≥130/85 mmHg.  
- Fasting glucose ≥100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L).  
- Triglycerides ≥150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L).  
- HDL cholesterol <40 mg/dL (men) or <50 mg/dL (women).  

**Treatment options:**  
- Lifestyle changes: diet, exercise, weight reduction.  
- Medications: antihypertensives, statins, glucose-lowering drugs.  
- Monitoring and addressing each risk factor.  

## Risks / Prognosis
- Doubles risk of cardiovascular disease.  
- Increases type 2 diabetes risk five-fold.  
- Early lifestyle intervention can reverse or prevent progression.  

## FAQ
**Q: Can metabolic syndrome be reversed?**  
A: Yes. Weight loss, physical activity, and improved diet can normalize risk factors in many people.  

**Q: Is it the same as diabetes?**  
A: No. But it often precedes type 2 diabetes and signals increased risk.
