## Intro
A large Mayo Clinic community study shows that many heart attacks in adults ≤65—especially women—are **not** caused by classic plaque blockages. Non-atherosclerotic causes like **SCAD**, **coronary embolism**, **coronary spasm**, and **supply–demand mismatch** were frequent and often misdiagnosed. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## Key Points
- **Beyond plaque:** In women ≤65, fewer than half of heart attacks were due to atherosclerosis; in men, about three-quarters were. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- **SCAD matters:** SCAD—often in younger, otherwise healthy women—was commonly missed when treated as a typical plaque MI. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- **Triggers & mismatch:** Conditions like anemia or infection can precipitate MI without major plaque and carry meaningful risk. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- **Correct diagnosis = safer care:** Some SCAD cases are best managed conservatively rather than with routine stenting. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

## Background
Researchers analyzed **15 years** of Olmsted County (Rochester Epidemiology Project) data and adjudicated MI causes in patients **≤65 years**. After excluding periprocedural events, **1,474** MIs were classified by underlying mechanism, revealing stark **sex differences** in causation. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

## Causes or Mechanisms
- **Atherosclerotic MI (plaque rupture/erosion/embolization):** Most common overall but **<50%** in women vs **~75%** in men. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
- **SCAD:** Arterial wall tear; predilection for women; may be misread on angiography without careful imaging. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- **Coronary embolism & spasm:** Non-plaque occlusions or transient constrictions. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
- **Supply–demand mismatch:** Systemic stressors (e.g., anemia, infection) tipping the heart into ischemia/MI. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

## Diagnosis / Treatment / Options
- **Imaging:** Coronary angiography with consideration of **OCT/IVUS** to detect SCAD or subtle non-plaque causes.  
- **SCAD management:** Often **conservative** if stable; stenting reserved for ongoing ischemia/left-main/proximal critical cases.  
- **Plaque MI:** Rapid reperfusion (PCI) and guideline-directed antithrombotic/lipid-lowering therapy.  
- **Mismatch/triggered MI:** Treat the **underlying stressor** (e.g., transfuse for severe anemia, treat infection) alongside cardiac care. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

## Risks / Benefits / Prognosis
- **Misdiagnosis risk:** Treating SCAD like plaque MI can expose patients to unnecessary stents and complications. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  
- **Prognosis varies:** Outcomes depend on cause (e.g., SCAD vs plaque vs mismatch) and timeliness of correct treatment. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}

## FAQ
**Q: I’m under 50 and had chest pain—could it be a heart attack without clogged arteries?**  
A: Yes. Non-plaque causes (like SCAD) are more common in younger women; seek emergency care and mention these possibilities. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}

**Q: How do doctors tell SCAD from a typical heart attack?**  
A: Detailed angiography and sometimes OCT/IVUS help reveal arterial tears or other non-plaque features. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}

**Q: Does treatment differ?**  
A: Yes. Some SCAD cases are better managed without stents; plaque MI usually requires rapid artery opening plus medications. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}

**Q: What if my MI was triggered by illness like flu or severe anemia?**  
A: Treating the trigger is crucial along with cardiac care; your team will tailor meds and follow-up to your cause. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}

**Q: Can this happen again?**  
A: Recurrence risk depends on the cause (e.g., SCAD recurrence is possible). Follow a specialist plan and attend all follow-ups. :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}
