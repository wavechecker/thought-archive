# Testing & Screening — Guide Hub

Medical tests help detect, monitor, and guide treatment of health conditions. This hub brings together guides on screening programs, home monitoring, and understanding what your results mean.

## What Testing Is For

Medical tests serve different purposes depending on the clinical situation:

- **Screening** looks for early signs of disease in people who have no symptoms. The goal is to catch problems early, when treatment is most effective. Examples include bowel cancer screening and cervical screening.
- **Diagnosis** confirms or rules out a condition after symptoms appear or an abnormal screening result is found. Diagnostic tests are usually more specific and targeted.
- **Monitoring** tracks an existing condition over time to guide treatment decisions. Examples include HbA1c for diabetes management, home blood pressure readings, and pulse oximetry.

Not every test fits neatly into one category — some are used for both screening and monitoring depending on context.

## Common Screening Programs

Most countries run organised screening programs for conditions where early detection improves outcomes. Common examples include:

- **Bowel (colorectal) cancer** — stool-based tests or colonoscopy, typically starting between ages 45–50.
- **Cervical cancer** — HPV testing and/or cytology (Pap smear), starting in early adulthood with intervals that vary by country.
- **Breast cancer** — mammography programs, often for women aged 50–74.
- **Blood pressure** — regular checks recommended for all adults.
- **Blood glucose / HbA1c** — for people at risk of diabetes.

Screening recommendations change over time as evidence evolves. Your national health authority publishes up-to-date schedules.

## How to Interpret Results

Understanding test results requires knowing a few key concepts:

- **Sensitivity** — how good a test is at correctly identifying people who have the condition (true positive rate). A highly sensitive test rarely misses real cases.
- **Specificity** — how good a test is at correctly identifying people who do not have the condition (true negative rate). A highly specific test rarely produces false alarms.
- **False positive** — the test says positive, but you do not actually have the condition. This can lead to anxiety and unnecessary follow-up.
- **False negative** — the test says negative, but you do actually have the condition. This can create false reassurance.

No test is perfect. Screening programs are designed so that the benefits of early detection outweigh the harms of false results across a population — but individual results always need clinical context.

## When to Ask Your Clinician

Consider discussing testing with your clinician if:

- You are unsure which screening tests are recommended for your age and risk profile.
- You received an abnormal result and want to understand what it means and what happens next.
- You have a family history of a condition and want to know whether earlier or additional screening is appropriate.
- You are monitoring a condition at home (e.g. blood pressure, blood glucose) and are unsure whether your readings need action.
- You have seen a test advertised directly to consumers and want to know whether it is evidence-based and relevant to you.

Your clinician can help you weigh the benefits and limitations of any test in your specific situation.
