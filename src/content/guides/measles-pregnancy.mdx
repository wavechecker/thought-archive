# Measles and Pregnancy

## Intro
**Measles (rubeola)** is a highly contagious viral infection that can cause **more severe illness during pregnancy**. While measles does **not** typically cause a well-defined congenital syndrome, infection — especially in **early pregnancy** — is associated with **miscarriage, preterm birth, and serious maternal complications**.

Because the **MMR vaccine is usually not given during pregnancy**, prevention relies on **pre-pregnancy immunity** and **urgent action after exposure**.

For general disease information, see **[Measles (Rubeola)](/guides/measles)**.

---

## Key Points
- Measles infection during pregnancy can lead to **pregnancy loss and preterm delivery**
- **First trimester infection carries the highest miscarriage risk**
- Severe maternal illness (pneumonia, hospitalization) is more common in pregnancy
- Measles does **not** cause a classic congenital malformation syndrome
- Prevention before pregnancy is the safest strategy

## Why Measles Is Riskier During Pregnancy
Pregnancy alters immune and respiratory function. When measles occurs, this can result in:
- Higher viral burden
- More severe fever and inflammation
- Increased risk of pneumonia and hospitalization
- Greater physiological stress on the placenta and fetus

---

## Risks by Trimester

### First Trimester (Weeks 1–12) — **Highest Risk Period**
The **first trimester**, especially **weeks 5–10**, is the most vulnerable period.

Associated risks include:
- **Miscarriage / spontaneous abortion**
- Severe maternal fever contributing to fetal loss
- Dehydration and systemic illness affecting placental support

<Aside title="Critical window" variant="warning">
Infection during weeks **5–10** carries the greatest risk of pregnancy loss due to fever, hypoxia, and systemic inflammation.
</Aside>

Measles does **not** reliably cause structural birth defects, but early pregnancy loss risk is clearly elevated.

---

### Second Trimester (Weeks 13–27)
Risks shift from miscarriage to **pregnancy complications**, including:
- **Preterm labor**
- Placental dysfunction
- Maternal pneumonia requiring hospitalization

Fetal growth restriction has been reported in some cases, likely secondary to maternal illness rather than direct viral effects.

---

### Third Trimester (Weeks 28–Birth)
Later pregnancy infection is associated with:
- **Preterm birth**
- Increased likelihood of cesarean delivery due to maternal illness
- Risk of **neonatal measles** if infection occurs near delivery

Maternal respiratory compromise is a major concern in this stage.

---

## Maternal Complications
Pregnant people with measles have higher rates of:
- Pneumonia
- Hospital admission
- Dehydration and electrolyte imbalance
- Rare but serious neurological complications

---

## Before Pregnancy: Best Protection
If pregnancy is planned or possible:
- Confirm **two documented MMR doses**
- If records are unclear, discuss serologic testing or vaccination
- If MMR is given, follow local guidance on the recommended waiting period before conception

<Aside title="Prevention matters" variant="info">
Because MMR is avoided during pregnancy, immunity gaps should be addressed **before conception whenever possible**.
</Aside>

---

## During Pregnancy: Reducing Exposure Risk
During outbreaks:
- Avoid crowded indoor environments where feasible
- Minimize time in waiting rooms
- Ensure household contacts are vaccinated if eligible
- Follow public health guidance closely

---

## What to Do After Possible Exposure
1. **Contact your clinician or public health unit immediately**
2. Provide:
   - Gestational age
   - Vaccination history or uncertainty
   - Time and location of exposure
3. Follow guidance on:
   - Post-exposure management
   - Symptom monitoring
   - Isolation if symptoms develop

<Aside title="Do not wait" variant="warning">
Post-exposure interventions are time-dependent. Seek advice even if you feel well.
</Aside>

---

## Symptoms Requiring Urgent Review
- High or persistent fever
- Cough with shortness of breath
- Rash with systemic illness
- Reduced fetal movements (later pregnancy)

---

## Breastfeeding and Postpartum Considerations
After delivery:
- Non-immune individuals can usually receive MMR postpartum
- Breastfeeding is not a contraindication to vaccination
- Newborn protection depends on maternal immunity and community coverage

---

## FAQ
**Q: Does measles cause birth defects like rubella?**  
A: No. Measles does not cause a classic congenital syndrome, but it significantly increases the risk of miscarriage and preterm birth.

**Q: What if I was vaccinated years ago?**  
A: Two documented doses usually provide long-lasting protection. If unsure, a clinician can advise on testing or risk assessment.

**Q: Can measles be transmitted to the newborn?**  
A: Yes, particularly if maternal infection occurs close to delivery.
