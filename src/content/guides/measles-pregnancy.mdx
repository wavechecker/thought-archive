faq:
  - q: "Is measles dangerous during early pregnancy?"
    a: "Yes. Measles infection in early pregnancy is associated with increased risk of miscarriage and severe maternal illness, particularly due to high fever and systemic inflammation."
  - q: "Can measles cause birth defects?"
    a: "Measles is not classically associated with a specific congenital syndrome, but infection during pregnancy increases the risk of pregnancy loss, preterm birth, and fetal complications."
  - q: "Can I get the MMR vaccine during pregnancy?"
    a: "No. MMR is a live attenuated vaccine and is generally avoided during pregnancy. Immunity should be confirmed before conception."

# Measles and Pregnancy

## Intro
**Measles (rubeola)** is a highly contagious viral infection that can cause **more severe illness during pregnancy**. While measles does **not** typically cause a well-defined congenital syndrome, infection — especially in **early pregnancy** — is associated with **miscarriage, preterm birth, and serious maternal complications**.

Because the **MMR vaccine is usually not given during pregnancy**, prevention relies on **pre-pregnancy immunity** and **urgent action after exposure**.

For general disease information, see **[Measles (Rubeola)](/guides/measles)**.

---

## Key Points
- Measles infection during pregnancy can lead to **pregnancy loss and preterm delivery**
- **First trimester infection carries the highest miscarriage risk**
- Severe maternal illness (pneumonia, hospitalization) is more common in pregnancy
- Measles does **not** cause a classic congenital malformation syndrome
- Prevention before pregnancy is the safest strategy

---

## Pregnancy Risk Stratification

**High risk:**
- Unvaccinated or no proof of immunity
- Exposure during outbreak
- First trimester infection

**Medium risk:**
- One documented MMR dose

**Low risk:**
- Two documented MMR doses / proven immunity

---

## Why Measles Is Riskier During Pregnancy
Pregnancy alters immune and respiratory function. When measles occurs, this can result in:
- Higher viral burden
- More severe fever and inflammation
- Increased risk of pneumonia and hospitalization
- Greater physiological stress on the placenta and fetus

---

## Risks by Trimester

### First Trimester (Weeks 1–12) — **Highest Risk Period**
The **first trimester**, especially **weeks 5–10**, is the most vulnerable period.

Associated risks include:
- **Miscarriage / spontaneous abortion**
- Severe maternal fever contributing to fetal loss
- Dehydration and systemic illness affecting placental support

<aside class="explainer-box">
  <h3>Critical window</h3>
  <p>Infection during weeks <strong>5–10</strong> carries the greatest risk of pregnancy loss due to fever, hypoxia, and systemic inflammation.</p>
</aside>

Measles does **not** reliably cause structural birth defects, but early pregnancy loss risk is clearly elevated.

---

### Second Trimester (Weeks 13–27)
Risks shift from miscarriage to **pregnancy complications**, including:
- **Preterm labor**
- Placental dysfunction
- Maternal pneumonia requiring hospitalization

Fetal growth restriction has been reported in some cases, likely secondary to maternal illness rather than direct viral effects.

---

### Third Trimester (Weeks 28–Birth)
Later pregnancy infection is associated with:
- **Preterm birth**
- Increased likelihood of cesarean delivery due to maternal illness
- Risk of **neonatal measles** if infection occurs near delivery

Maternal respiratory compromise is a major concern in this stage.

---

## Maternal Complications
Pregnant people with measles have higher rates of:
- Pneumonia
- Hospital admission
- Dehydration and electrolyte imbalance
- Rare but serious neurological complications

---

## Before Pregnancy: Best Protection
If pregnancy is planned or possible:
- Confirm **two documented MMR doses**
- If records are unclear, discuss serologic testing or vaccination
- If MMR is given, follow local guidance on the recommended waiting period before conception

<aside class="explainer-box">
  <h3>Prevention matters</h3>
  <p>Because MMR is avoided during pregnancy, immunity gaps should be addressed <strong>before conception whenever possible</strong>.</p>
</aside>

---

## During Pregnancy: Reducing Exposure Risk
During outbreaks:
- Avoid crowded indoor environments where feasible
- Minimize time in waiting rooms
- Ensure household contacts are vaccinated if eligible
- Follow public health guidance closely

---

## What to Do After Possible Exposure
1. **Contact your clinician or public health unit immediately**
2. Provide:
   - Gestational age
   - Vaccination history or uncertainty
   - Time and location of exposure
3. Follow guidance on:
   - Post-exposure management
   - Symptom monitoring
   - Isolation if symptoms develop

<aside class="explainer-box">
  <h3>Do not wait</h3>
  <p>Post-exposure interventions are time-dependent. Seek advice even if you feel well.</p>
</aside>

## FAQ
**Q: What if my immunity is unclear during pregnancy?**
A: Discuss serologic testing with your clinician. If confirmed non-immune, focus on minimizing exposure risk and knowing your action plan after exposure.

**Q: Can I be around people recently vaccinated with MMR?**
A: Yes. MMR vaccine virus is generally not spread from vaccinated individuals to others.

**Q: Does measles infection guarantee problems for the baby?**
A: Not all pregnancies with measles result in adverse outcomes, but the risks are elevated compared to uninfected pregnancies. The highest risks occur with infection in early pregnancy.
