# Hypertension: The Silent Killer Explained Simply

## Overview
Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is often called the “silent killer” because it usually has no symptoms until serious damage has occurred. Left untreated, it can lead to heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, and other life-threatening conditions.

## Key Points
- Hypertension is defined as **blood pressure consistently above 140/90 mmHg**.
- It often develops slowly over years.
- Lifestyle changes can lower blood pressure and reduce complications.
- Regular monitoring is key — even if you feel well.

## What is Blood Pressure?
Blood pressure measures the force of blood pushing against artery walls. It is recorded as:
- **Systolic (top number)**: pressure when the heart beats.
- **Diastolic (bottom number)**: pressure when the heart rests between beats.

Example: **120/80 mmHg** is considered normal.

## Types of Hypertension

### Primary (Essential) Hypertension
- Most common type.
- Develops gradually with no identifiable cause.
- Linked to aging, genetics, and lifestyle factors.

### Secondary Hypertension
- Caused by an underlying condition (e.g., kidney disease, hormonal disorders).
- May appear suddenly and cause higher readings than primary hypertension.

## Risk Factors
- Being overweight or obese
- Sedentary lifestyle
- High salt intake
- Excessive alcohol use
- Smoking
- Chronic stress
- Family history

## Possible Symptoms (When Severe)
Most people feel no symptoms. Severe cases may cause:
- Headaches
- Nosebleeds
- Shortness of breath
- Vision changes

## Diagnosis
- Confirmed by multiple readings over time.
- May require **24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring**.

## Management and Treatment
- Reduce salt intake.
- Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables.
- Exercise regularly.
- Maintain a healthy weight.
- Limit alcohol and quit smoking.
- Medications such as diuretics, ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, or calcium channel blockers may be prescribed.

## FAQs

**Q: Can hypertension be cured?**  
A: It can often be managed effectively, but many people need lifelong treatment.

**Q: How often should I check my blood pressure?**  
A: If you have hypertension, check it as recommended by your doctor — often daily or weekly at home.

**Q: Can stress alone cause high blood pressure?**  
A: Stress can cause temporary spikes, but chronic hypertension usually involves multiple factors.
