## Intro
Testosterone is the primary male sex hormone, vital for sexual function, energy, muscle mass, and mood. Low testosterone (hypogonadism) can affect quality of life and long-term health. Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) may restore levels, but it requires careful diagnosis and monitoring.

## Key Points
- **Symptoms** of low testosterone include fatigue, reduced libido, mood changes, and muscle loss.  
- **Diagnosis** requires both symptoms and laboratory confirmation of low serum testosterone.  
- **Testing** is done in the morning, often on at least two occasions, with total testosterone <300 ng/dL (~10.4 nmol/L) as a common cutoff.  
- **Treatment options** include injections, gels, patches, pellets, and oral formulations.  
- **Risks/benefits**: TRT can improve energy, libido, and bone/muscle health, but carries risks such as fertility suppression, prostate monitoring concerns, and possible cardiovascular effects.

## Background
Testosterone levels decline naturally with age, but true hypogonadism results from testicular, pituitary, or hypothalamic dysfunction. It is important to distinguish normal aging from clinically significant deficiency.

## Causes or Mechanisms
- **Primary hypogonadism**: testicular failure (e.g., Klinefelter syndrome, injury, chemotherapy).  
- **Secondary hypogonadism**: pituitary or hypothalamic dysfunction (e.g., tumors, chronic illness, obesity).  
- **Age-related decline**: gradual decrease, but not always requiring TRT.  

## Diagnosis and Laboratory Findings
- **When to test**: men with consistent symptoms (fatigue, low libido, erectile dysfunction, depression, decreased muscle/bone mass).  
- **Blood test**: total testosterone, drawn in the morning (7–10 am).  
- **Confirming low T**: typically <300 ng/dL (10.4 nmol/L). Reference ranges vary by lab.  
- **Additional tests**: free testosterone, LH, FSH, prolactin, SHBG to determine cause.  
- **Repeat testing**: needed to confirm abnormal results.  

## Types of Testosterone Replacement Therapy
- **Intramuscular injections** (testosterone enanthate, cypionate, undecanoate): given every 1–12 weeks depending on preparation.  
- **Transdermal gels/creams**: applied daily, steady absorption, risk of skin transfer.  
- **Patches**: applied daily, can cause skin irritation.  
- **Subcutaneous pellets**: implanted under skin, last 3–6 months.  
- **Oral testosterone undecanoate**: absorbed via lymphatic system, newer option in some regions.  

## Risks / Benefits / Prognosis
- **Benefits**: improved libido, energy, muscle strength, bone density, mood.  
- **Risks**: acne, fluid retention, breast enlargement, reduced fertility (sperm suppression), polycythemia (high red cell count).  
- **Long-term concerns**: cardiovascular risk is debated; prostate cancer screening required before and during TRT.  
- **Prognosis**: most men respond well if carefully selected, monitored, and managed.  

## FAQ
**Q: Who should consider TRT?**  
A: Men with both symptoms of low testosterone and consistently low lab results.  

**Q: Can TRT restore fertility?**  
A: No. In fact, TRT usually suppresses sperm production. Other treatments (e.g., clomiphene, gonadotropins) may be used if fertility is desired.  

**Q: How often are labs monitored?**  
A: Typically at 3–6 months after starting therapy, then annually (testosterone, hematocrit, PSA, liver function, lipid profile).  

**Q: Is TRT safe long-term?**  
A: Evidence is mixed; it can be safe with monitoring, but risks include blood thickening, prostate enlargement, and uncertain cardiovascular effects.
