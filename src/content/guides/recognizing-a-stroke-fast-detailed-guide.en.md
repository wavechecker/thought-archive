# Recognizing a Stroke FAST — A Practical Guide

With stroke, **time = brain**. Early treatment improves outcomes.

## Summary
Use **FAST**: Face droop, Arm weakness, Speech difficulty — **Time to call emergency services** immediately.

## FAST — the quick test
- **F — Face:** drooping or uneven smile  
- **A — Arm:** one arm drifts down  
- **S — Speech:** slurred or trouble speaking/understanding  
- **T — Time:** call emergency services now

## Other warning signs
- Sudden **vision loss** or double vision  
- Sudden **severe headache**, especially with neck stiffness  
- Sudden **confusion**, **dizziness**, **balance problems**  
- Sudden **numbness/weakness** on one side

## What to do (and not do)
- Call emergency services; **do not drive yourself**  
- Note **time of symptom onset**  
- **Do not** start aspirin if hemorrhage is possible (e.g., thunderclap headache)  
- Stay with the person; keep airway clear

## After a TIA (“mini-stroke”)
