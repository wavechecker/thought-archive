## Intro
Hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) is a common risk in T1D. Fast recognition and treatment prevent harm, and smart prevention reduces how often lows happen.

## Key Points
- Treat **immediately** if < **3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL)** or if symptomatic.  
- Use the **Rule of 15** (15–20 g fast carbs → recheck in 15 min).  
- Identify **triggers** (insulin timing/amount, exercise, alcohol, missed meals).  
- Recurrent or severe lows → **adjust regimen** with your diabetes team.

## Recognizing a Low
- **Adrenergic:** shakiness, sweating, palpitations, anxiety, hunger.  
- **Neuroglycopenic:** headache, blurred vision, confusion, irritability, drowsiness.  
- **Severe:** seizures, unconsciousness (needs help from others).

CGM trend arrows help anticipate drops; confirm with finger-stick if readings don’t match how you feel.

## Immediate Treatment — Rule of 15
1. Take **15–20 g fast-acting carbs**  
   - e.g., 4 glucose tabs (≈16 g), 150–200 ml juice, glucose gel.  
2. **Recheck in 15 minutes.**  
3. If still < **3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL)**, repeat step 1.  
4. If the next meal is **>1 hour away**, add a **slow carb** (toast, crackers).  

> Avoid chocolate or high-fat foods for the initial correction—they act too slowly.

## Severe Hypoglycaemia
- If unconscious or unable to swallow: a trained person should give **glucagon**  
  - **Nasal** (spray) or **injectable** per device instructions.  
- **Call emergency services.**  
- Place on side (recovery position) once breathing is safe.

## Common Triggers & Fixes
- **Too much bolus / wrong timing:** review insulin-to-carb ratio and pre-meal timing.  
- **Basal set too high:** look for patterns at the same time daily → discuss basal reduction.  
- **Exercise (during/after):** reduce bolus/basal around activity; carry fast carbs.  
- **Alcohol:** eat with drinks; check before bed and overnight.  
- **Missed/low-carb meals:** match bolus to actual carbs; consider smaller correction doses.

## Prevention Strategies
- Set **CGM low alerts** (and predictive alerts) appropriately; consider higher overnight thresholds if prone to nocturnal lows.  
- Use **temp basal reductions** on pumps for planned activity; with MDI, reduce bolus or add carbs.  
- Rotate **injection/infusion sites** to avoid unpredictable absorption.  
- Keep **hypo kit** (glucose + glucagon) accessible at home, work, school, and during exercise.

## After a Low
- Note the **time, activity, insulin, and food** leading up to it.  
- If two or more lows occur in a week—or any severe episode—contact your team to reassess doses.  
- Consider brief **target adjustments** (slightly higher) after clusters of lows.

## FAQ
**Do I need to eat after I’m back above 3.9 mmol/L?**  
If your next meal is far away, add a **slow carb** to prevent another dip.

**My CGM says I’m low but I feel fine.**  
Confirm with a **finger-stick**; treat if confirmed or if trend arrows show a fast drop.

**Why do I get lows overnight?**  
Common reasons: **too much basal**, **evening exercise**, or **alcohol**. Adjust plan and consider higher overnight alerts.
