# Type 1 Diabetes ‚Äî Managing Hypoglycaemia

Hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar) is one of the most common and urgent risks in type 1 diabetes. Fast recognition and treatment prevent harm, and prevention strategies reduce how often lows happen.

---

## üöë Bottom Line
- Treat immediately if < **3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL)** or if symptomatic.  
- Use the **Rule of 15** (15 g fast carbs ‚Üí recheck in 15 minutes).  
- If severe (can‚Äôt swallow, seizures, unconscious) ‚Üí **glucagon + call emergency services**.  

---

## Recognising a Low
- **Adrenergic signs:** shakiness, sweating, palpitations, anxiety, hunger.  
- **Neuroglycopenic signs:** headache, blurred vision, confusion, irritability, drowsiness.  
- **Severe:** seizures or unconsciousness ‚Äî requires help from others.  

CGM trend arrows can help anticipate drops; confirm with a finger-stick if readings don‚Äôt match how you feel.

## Immediate Treatment ‚Äî Rule of 15
1. Take **15‚Äì20 g fast-acting carbs**  
   - e.g., 4 glucose tabs (‚âà16 g), 150‚Äì200 ml juice, glucose gel.  
2. **Recheck in 15 minutes.**  
3. If still < **3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL)**, repeat step 1.  
4. If the next meal is >1 hour away, add a **slow carb** (toast, crackers).  

> Avoid chocolate or high-fat foods for the initial correction ‚Äî they act too slowly.

## Severe Hypoglycaemia
‚ö†Ô∏è If unconscious or unable to swallow:  
- A trained person should give **glucagon** (nasal or injectable).  
- **Call emergency services immediately.**  
- Place on the side (recovery position) once breathing is safe.  

---

## Common Triggers & Fixes
- **Too much bolus / wrong timing:** review insulin-to-carb ratio and pre-meal timing.  
- **Basal too high:** patterns at the same time each day may signal a basal adjustment need.  
- **Exercise (during/after):** reduce insulin or add carbs; carry fast carbs at all times.  
- **Alcohol:** eat with drinks; check before bed and overnight.  
- **Missed/low-carb meals:** match bolus to actual carbs; use smaller corrections.  

---

## Prevention Strategies
- Set **CGM low alerts** (and predictive alerts) appropriately; higher overnight if prone to nocturnal lows.  
- Use **temp basal reductions** on pumps around activity; with MDI, reduce bolus or add carbs.  
- Rotate **injection/infusion sites** to avoid unpredictable absorption.  
- Keep a **hypo kit** (glucose + glucagon) at home, work, school, and during exercise.  

---

## After a Low
- Record **time, activity, insulin, and food** leading up to the episode.  
- If 2+ lows in a week ‚Äî or any severe hypo ‚Äî contact your team to reassess insulin dosing.  
- Consider temporary **higher glucose targets** after clusters of lows.

## FAQ
**Do I need to eat after I‚Äôm back above 3.9 mmol/L?**  
If your next meal is far away, add a slow carb to prevent another dip.  

**My CGM says I‚Äôm low but I feel fine.**  
Confirm with a finger-stick; treat if confirmed or if dropping quickly.  

**Why do I get lows overnight?**  
Often due to too much basal insulin, evening exercise, or alcohol. Adjust your plan and consider higher overnight CGM alerts.
