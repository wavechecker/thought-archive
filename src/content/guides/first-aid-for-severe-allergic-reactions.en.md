# First Aid for Severe Allergic Reactions (Anaphylaxis)

**Anaphylaxis** is life-threatening and needs **immediate epinephrine** and emergency care.

## Summary
At the first sign of multi-system symptoms after exposure (skin + breathing and/or circulation/GI), **use epinephrine right away** and call emergency services.

## Recognize anaphylaxis
- **Skin:** hives, flushing, swelling of lips/tongue/face  
- **Breathing:** wheeze, hoarse voice, tight throat, shortness of breath  
- **Circulation:** dizziness, fainting, weak/rapid pulse, low BP  
- **GI:** severe abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea

## What to do — step by step
1. **Epinephrine auto-injector immediately** into outer thigh  
2. **Call emergency services**  
3. Lay on back with legs raised (or on side if vomiting)  
4. If breathing issues, use prescribed inhaler **after epinephrine**  
5. If no improvement in 5–10 min and a second injector is available, **use it**  
6. Monitor breathing/pulse until help arrives

## Aftercare
- All patients need evaluation; **biphasic reactions** can occur hours later  
- Ask for an **allergy action plan** and training for caregivers

## FAQs
**Antihistamines first?** No—**epinephrine is first-line**.  
**Where to inject?** Mid-outer thigh, through clothing if needed.
