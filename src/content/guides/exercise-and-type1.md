# Exercise and Type 1 Diabetes

## How exercise affects glucose
- Aerobic → tends to **lower** BGL (risk of hypos).  
- Anaerobic/sprint → may **raise** BGL short term.  
- Effects can last hours.

## Before activity
- Check BGL; if low, treat first.  
- Have glucose on hand.  
- Adjust insulin if planned strenuous exercise.

## During
- Monitor every 30–60 min for longer sessions.  
- Use CGM alerts if available.  
- Drink water regularly.

## After
- Watch for delayed hypos (overnight).  
- Consider reduced basal or extra carbs if needed.
