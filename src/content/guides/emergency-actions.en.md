# Emergency Actions — Hypos, Highs, and Ketones

## Why this matters
In urgent situations, clear steps save time and reduce risk. Keep this guide with your diabetes plan and supplies.

## Severe hypo (can’t swallow / unconscious / seizure)
- **Do not give food/fluids by mouth.**  
- **Glucagon** (nasal or injection) if available and trained to use.  
- **Call emergency services.**  
- Once awake: longer-acting carbs; contact your diabetes team.

## High BGL **with** ketones (sick day)
- **Hydrate** with **unsweetened fluids**; small sips every 5–10 min.  
- **Correction insulin** per your plan.  
- **Recheck BGL & ketones in 1–2 hours.**  
- **Pump users:** give correction by **pen/syringe** and **change set** if ketones present.  
- **Seek urgent care** if ketones **≥3.0 mmol/L**, ketones rising, or if **vomiting/pain/drowsiness/rapid breathing** develop.

## Vomiting or unable to keep fluids down
- High risk for **DKA** even if BGL isn’t very high.  
- Try **small frequent sips**; if not tolerated, **seek urgent medical help**.  
- Do **not stop basal insulin**.

## Driving safety
- If you feel low or your CGM alarms low → **pull over** and treat.  
- Do not drive until BGL has clearly recovered and you feel well.

## What to keep in an “emergency kit”
- Glucose tablets/gel; small juice or regular soft drink  
- Glucagon (check expiry); instructions  
- Meter/strips or CGM; ketone strips/meter  
- Spare pen needles/syringes; pump set  
- Copy of your **diabetes plan** and emergency contacts
