# Vaccine Mandates and Exemptions

## Intro
Vaccine mandates are laws or policies requiring certain vaccinations to access education, employment, or public spaces. They have played a critical role in maintaining high coverage and preventing outbreaks, but remain a point of political and ethical debate.

## Key Points
- Mandates aim to protect public health by ensuring high vaccination rates.  
- Exemptions may be medical, religious, or philosophical, depending on jurisdiction.  
- Stricter policies correlate with higher coverage and fewer outbreaks.  
- Critics argue mandates infringe on personal autonomy and parental choice.  

## Background
- **Historical use:** School-entry mandates in the US date back to the 19th century. Many countries have similar policies for childhood immunisation.  
- **COVID-19:** Brought mandates for healthcare workers, travel, and public venues — intensifying debates worldwide.  

## Types of Exemptions
- **Medical:** For individuals with contraindications (e.g., severe allergy, immunodeficiency).  
- **Religious:** Allowed in some countries; definitions vary.  
- **Philosophical/personal belief:** Permitted in fewer jurisdictions; often associated with lower coverage.  

## Evidence
- Jurisdictions with broader non-medical exemptions experience more outbreaks of measles and pertussis.  
- Removing or tightening exemptions often increases coverage quickly.  
- Mandates are most accepted when linked clearly to community protection (e.g., schools, hospitals).  

## Risks / Benefits
- **Benefits:** Protect vulnerable populations, maintain herd immunity, reduce outbreaks.  
- **Risks:** Potential backlash, loss of trust, politicisation of vaccination.  

## FAQ
**Q: Do mandates violate human rights?**  
A: WHO and legal experts note that mandates can be ethical if proportionate, evidence-based, and with medical exemptions.  

**Q: Are medical exemptions common?**  
A: No. They account for a very small proportion of exemptions. Most exemptions are non-medical where permitted.
