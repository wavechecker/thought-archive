## Intro
GLP-1 receptor agonists are widely prescribed for diabetes and obesity, but reports of side effects range from well-established to speculative. This guide separates **high-confidence evidence** from **conjecture** and **true unknowns**.

## Key Points
- Gastrointestinal symptoms are common and dose-dependent  
- Appetite suppression is the intended therapeutic effect  
- Weight loss often includes lean mass loss  
- Several long-term risks remain uncertain  

<StratBox title="Clinical Risk Summary" level="moderate">
GLP-1 medications have well-documented short-term side effects and emerging long-term questions. Risks are generally acceptable in obesity and diabetes, but uncertainty increases in lower-risk populations.
</StratBox>

## Background
GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) is a gut hormone involved in glucose regulation, gastric emptying, and satiety. Pharmacologic GLP-1 agonists amplify these signals, affecting the **gut–brain–pancreas axis**.

## Confirmed Side Effects (High Confidence)

### Gastrointestinal effects
- Nausea and vomiting  
- Constipation or diarrhea  
- Abdominal bloating or discomfort  

These effects are dose-related and most prominent during treatment escalation.

### Weight loss with lean mass loss
GLP-1–associated weight loss includes both fat and lean mass. Without resistance training and adequate protein intake, **muscle loss can be clinically meaningful**, particularly in older adults.

### Gallbladder disease
Rapid weight loss increases the risk of gallstones and cholecystitis. This risk is shared with other rapid weight-loss interventions.

  title="Strength of Evidence"
  evidence="High for gastrointestinal effects and weight loss; moderate for gallbladder disease; low to moderate for psychiatric and long-term outcomes."

## Plausible but Not Settled

### Pancreatitis
Large trials have not shown a strong causal relationship, but rare cases continue to be monitored through post-marketing surveillance.

### Gastroparesis
GLP-1 drugs deliberately slow gastric emptying. Whether they can cause persistent gastroparesis after discontinuation remains unclear.

### Mood and reward changes
Appetite and reward pathways overlap neurologically. Evidence for clinically significant mood changes is inconsistent.

## Unknowns
- Effects of decades-long use  
- Neuroendocrine adaptation after discontinuation  
- Long-term impact on frailty and sarcopenia  

## FAQ
**Q: Are GLP-1 side effects permanent?**  
A: Most resolve with dose reduction or discontinuation, but long-term data is limited.

**Q: Are these risks unique to GLP-1 drugs?**  
A: Many overlap with risks from rapid weight loss via other methods.
