## Intro

A **vaccine** is a biological preparation that trains the immune system to recognise and fight a specific pathogen — without causing the disease itself. Vaccination is one of the most effective public health tools ever developed, preventing an estimated 4–5 million deaths worldwide each year.

**Immunity** means the body can mount a rapid, effective response when it encounters a pathogen it has been prepared for. This protection works on two levels:

- **Individual immunity:** Your own immune system recognises the threat and responds quickly, preventing or reducing illness.
- **Population (herd) immunity:** When enough people in a community are immune, the pathogen struggles to spread, indirectly protecting those who cannot be vaccinated — such as newborns, pregnant individuals, or people with compromised immune systems.

## How Vaccines Build Immunity

Vaccines introduce a harmless version of a pathogen — a weakened or inactivated form, a protein fragment, or genetic instructions (as in mRNA vaccines). The immune system responds by:

1. Recognising the foreign material (antigen).
2. Activating B cells (which produce antibodies) and T cells (which coordinate defence and destroy infected cells).
3. Forming **memory cells** that persist long after vaccination, ready to respond rapidly on future exposure.

This is the same mechanism the body uses after natural infection, but vaccines achieve it without the risks of the actual disease.

For a deeper look at immune mechanisms and vaccine types, see [How Vaccines Work](/guides/how-vaccines-work).

## Schedule Logic

Vaccination schedules are not arbitrary. They are designed around several principles:

- **Age windows:** Vaccines are timed to protect during the period of greatest vulnerability. Infants receive early doses because their immune systems are maturing and maternal antibody protection fades.
- **Risk-based timing:** Some vaccines are prioritised for specific groups — healthcare workers, travellers, pregnant individuals, or people with chronic conditions.
- **Dose spacing:** Multiple doses are often needed to build strong, lasting immunity. Minimum intervals between doses ensure the immune system has time to mount a full response before being boosted again.
- **Boosters:** Immunity from some vaccines wanes over time. Boosters restore protection — for example, tetanus and pertussis boosters in adolescence and adulthood.

Schedules are reviewed regularly by national advisory bodies and updated as new evidence, new vaccines, or changing disease patterns emerge.

For the routine childhood schedule in detail, see [Childhood Immunization Schedule](/guides/childhood-immunization-schedule).

## Benefits vs Risks

### Benefits
- Prevents serious illness, complications, disability, and death.
- Reduces community transmission, protecting vulnerable people who cannot be vaccinated.
- Can lead to disease elimination or eradication (smallpox was eradicated; polio is close).
- Reduces healthcare burden and supports economic stability.

### Risks
- **Common, mild reactions:** soreness at the injection site, low-grade fever, fatigue. These typically resolve within a day or two and are signs the immune system is responding.
- **Serious reactions:** extremely rare. Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) occur in roughly 1–2 per million doses and are treatable.
- **Ongoing monitoring:** safety surveillance systems worldwide (such as VAERS, EudraVigilance, and AusVaxSafety) continuously track adverse events after vaccines are approved.

The risk of harm from vaccine-preventable diseases is far greater than the risk from vaccines themselves. This balance is not a matter of opinion — it is supported by decades of data across billions of doses.

For more on safety monitoring, see [Adverse Events Monitoring](/guides/adverse-events-monitoring).

## Why Schedules Differ by Country

It is common to notice that different countries recommend slightly different vaccine schedules. This is not a sign of disagreement — it reflects **local optimisation** based on:

- **Disease burden:** Countries where a disease is more common may vaccinate earlier or more broadly.
- **Health system capacity:** Centralised systems with reliable follow-up can use different spacing than fragmented systems.
- **Cost-effectiveness analysis:** Public programs weigh benefits per dollar spent, which varies by setting.
- **Available products:** Specific vaccine brands and combinations differ by region.

The core principle is the same everywhere: protect as many people as effectively and equitably as possible.

## Common Misconceptions

- **"Vaccines cause autism."** This claim originated from a single 1998 study that was retracted for fraud. Multiple large-scale studies involving over a million children have found no link between vaccines and autism.
- **"Natural immunity is always better than vaccination."** Natural infection can provide immunity, but it comes with the risk of severe disease, complications, and death. Vaccines provide similar or stronger protection without those risks.
- **"Too many vaccines overwhelm the immune system."** A baby's immune system encounters thousands of antigens daily. The total antigen load from all routine vaccines combined is a tiny fraction of that natural exposure.
- **"Vaccines contain dangerous toxins."** Ingredients like aluminum adjuvants are present in very small, safe amounts — less than what is naturally consumed through food and water. Modern childhood vaccines no longer contain thimerosal.
- **"If most people are vaccinated, I don't need to be."** Herd immunity only works when coverage stays high. Gaps in vaccination allow outbreaks to return, as seen with measles resurgences when coverage drops below ~95%.
- **"Vaccine side effects are covered up."** Adverse event reporting systems are publicly accessible. Safety signals are investigated transparently, and vaccines have been withdrawn or modified when evidence warranted it.
