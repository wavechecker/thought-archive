faq:
  - q: "What causes pneumonia?"
    a: "Bacteria (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae), viruses (e.g., influenza, RSV), and — less commonly — fungi. Risk varies by age, setting, and exposure."
  - q: "When should I seek urgent care?"
    a: "If you have severe shortness of breath, persistent high fever, confusion, bluish lips/face, or chest pain — call emergency services."
  - q: "Is pneumonia contagious?"
    a: "Many causes are spread through respiratory droplets. Hand hygiene, masks during illness, and vaccination reduce risk."
  - q: "Can vaccines help?"
    a: "Yes — influenza and pneumococcal vaccines lower the risk of pneumonia and severe outcomes, especially in high-risk groups."

## Intro
Pneumonia is a lung infection that inflames the air sacs (alveoli). Fluid and pus can fill the sacs, making oxygen exchange harder. While many cases are mild, pneumonia can be severe or fatal in vulnerable people, so **early diagnosis and treatment** matter.

## Key Points
- Caused by **bacteria, viruses, or fungi**; severity ranges from mild to life-threatening.  
- Symptoms: **cough, fever, breathlessness, chest pain, fatigue**.  
- High-risk: **young children, older adults, smokers, chronic disease, immunosuppression**.  
- Treatment depends on cause: **antibiotics** (bacterial), **supportive care**, sometimes antivirals or antifungals.  
- Prevention: **vaccination, hand hygiene, smoking cessation**, prompt treatment of respiratory infections.

## Background
Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) develops outside hospitals; hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated cases occur during/after healthcare exposure and are often more severe or drug-resistant.

## Causes or Mechanisms
Pathogens reach alveoli via inhalation or aspiration. The immune response leads to inflammation and consolidation, impairing gas exchange and causing systemic symptoms.

## Diagnosis / Treatment / Options
**Diagnosis:** history/exam, pulse oximetry, chest X-ray, +/- labs (CBC, CRP), and in moderate-severe cases, cultures/viral tests.  
**Treatment:**  
- **Outpatient, mild:** oral antibiotics if bacterial is likely; rest, fluids, antipyretics.  
- **Severe or high-risk:** hospitalization, IV antibiotics, oxygen; manage complications (e.g., effusions).  
- **Viral pneumonia:** supportive care ± antivirals (e.g., influenza).  
**Source control:** drain empyema; treat aspiration risk.

## Risks / Benefits / Prognosis
Most healthy adults recover fully; risks rise with age/comorbidities. Complications include respiratory failure, sepsis, empyema, and prolonged fatigue.

## FAQ
**Q: How long until I feel better?**  
A: Fevers settle in 3–5 days; cough/fatigue can persist for weeks. Seek review if not improving.
