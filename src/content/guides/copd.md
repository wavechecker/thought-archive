faq:
  - q: "What is COPD?"
    a: "COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) is a long-term lung condition that makes it hard to breathe due to narrowed airways and damage to lung tissue."
  - q: "What are the main symptoms of COPD?"
    a: "Common symptoms include chronic cough, mucus production, wheezing, shortness of breath (especially on exertion), and frequent chest infections."
  - q: "What causes COPD?"
    a: "The main cause is long-term exposure to irritants, especially cigarette smoking. Air pollution, workplace dust, and genetic conditions like alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency also play a role."
  - q: "How is COPD diagnosed?"
    a: "Diagnosis is based on symptoms, a physical exam, and lung function tests (spirometry). Chest X-rays or CT scans may also be used."
  - q: "What treatments are available for COPD?"
    a: "There is no cure, but treatments include quitting smoking, inhalers (bronchodilators, steroids), pulmonary rehab, oxygen therapy, and in severe cases surgery or lung transplant."

## Intro
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive lung condition that makes it hard to breathe. It is most often caused by long-term smoking, but other factors like workplace exposures or genetics can also contribute.

## Key Points
- COPD includes **chronic bronchitis** and **emphysema**.  
- Main symptoms: cough, mucus, wheezing, and breathlessness.  
- Smoking is the leading cause, but not the only one.  
- No cure, but treatments improve symptoms and quality of life.  
- Severe cases may need oxygen or surgery.  

## Symptoms
- Chronic cough (often with sputum)  
- Wheezing or whistling sound while breathing  
- Shortness of breath, especially on exertion  
- Frequent respiratory infections  
- Fatigue and reduced exercise tolerance  

## Causes and Risk Factors
- **Smoking** (most common cause)  
- Long-term exposure to air pollution, dust, or workplace chemicals  
- Genetic factors (e.g., alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency)  
- Age (more common in people over 40)  

## Diagnosis
- **Spirometry:** measures airflow obstruction.  
- **Chest X-ray or CT scan:** shows lung damage (emphysema).  
- **Blood tests:** check oxygen and CO₂ levels.  
- **Physical exam:** listening to lungs, history of smoking or exposures.  

## Treatment
- **Quit smoking** — most important step.  
- **Inhalers:** bronchodilators and steroids reduce symptoms.  
- **Pulmonary rehabilitation:** exercise + breathing training.  
- **Oxygen therapy:** for advanced cases.  
- **Surgery:** lung volume reduction or transplant (rare).  

## Risks and Prognosis
- COPD is progressive but manageable.  
- Increases risk of heart disease, lung cancer, and pneumonia.  
- Life expectancy varies depending on severity and treatment.  
- Early diagnosis + quitting smoking slows progression.  

## FAQ
**Q: What is COPD?**  
A: A long-term lung disease that causes airflow limitation, usually due to smoking.  

**Q: What are the main symptoms?**  
A: Cough, sputum, wheezing, breathlessness, frequent infections.  

**Q: How is it diagnosed?**  
A: With lung function tests (spirometry), imaging, and medical history.  

**Q: Can COPD be cured?**  
A: No, but treatment controls symptoms and slows progression.  

**Q: What is the most important treatment?**  
A: Quitting smoking.
