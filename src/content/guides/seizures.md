## Intro
A seizure happens when there is abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Seizures may cause convulsions, staring spells, or loss of awareness. While many seizures end on their own, knowing **basic first aid** can protect the person and prevent injury.

## Key Points
- Stay calm and keep the person safe.  
- **Do not restrain** them or put anything in their mouth.  
- Time the seizure — if it lasts more than 5 minutes, call emergency services.  
- Most seizures resolve within 1–3 minutes.  
- After the seizure, place the person in the recovery position and reassure them.  

## First Aid During a Seizure
1. **Stay with the person** until it ends.  
2. **Move hazards away** (furniture, sharp objects).  
3. Place something soft under the head if possible.  
4. Loosen tight clothing around the neck.  
5. **Do not** try to restrain movements.  
6. **Do not** put anything in their mouth (risk of choking/obstruction).  
7. Note the **time seizure starts and ends**.  

## After the Seizure
- Once movements stop, roll the person onto their **side (recovery position)** to keep the airway clear.  
- Stay with them until fully alert.  
- Reassure them — confusion and fatigue are common afterwards.  

## When to Call Emergency Services
- Seizure lasts **longer than 5 minutes**.  
- Another seizure begins without full recovery in between.  
- First-ever seizure.  
- Breathing does not return to normal after seizure ends.  
- Seizure happens in water.  
- Person is injured, pregnant, or has other health conditions.  

## Types of Seizures (Quick Overview)
- **Generalized tonic-clonic**: full-body convulsions, loss of consciousness.  
- **Absence**: brief staring or blank spells, often in children.  
- **Focal**: twitching, unusual sensations, or loss of awareness affecting one part of the body.  

## Prevention and Preparedness
- People with epilepsy should follow prescribed medication and carry a seizure action plan.  
- Family, friends, and teachers can benefit from basic seizure first aid training.  
- Wearing a **medical alert bracelet** helps in emergencies.  

## FAQ
**Q: Should I put something in their mouth to stop them biting their tongue?**  
A: No. This can cause choking or injury.  

**Q: What if the person stops breathing during a seizure?**  
A: Call emergency services immediately. Start CPR if they remain unresponsive and not breathing once the seizure has ended.  

**Q: Can seizures be triggered by stress or lack of sleep?**  
A: Yes. Stress, missed medication, alcohol, or sleep deprivation are common triggers.
