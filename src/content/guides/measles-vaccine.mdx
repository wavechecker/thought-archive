# Measles Vaccine (MMR/MMRV)

## Intro
The measles vaccine is usually given as **MMR** (measles, mumps, rubella) or **MMRV** (MMR + varicella). It’s a core tool for preventing measles outbreaks.

For the broader illness overview, see **[Measles (Rubeola)](/guides/measles)**.

## Key Points
- **Two doses** provide strong protection for most people  
- Communities typically need **~95% two-dose coverage** to prevent sustained outbreaks  
- Catch-up vaccination is common and usually straightforward  
- Serious vaccine reactions are **rare**

## What the Vaccine Prevents
MMR protects against:
- **Measles** (rubeola) — highly contagious; can cause pneumonia/encephalitis  
- **Mumps** — salivary gland swelling; complications can occur  
- **Rubella** — mild in many, but dangerous in pregnancy  

## Routine Schedule
Schedules vary by country, but commonly include:
- **Dose 1** in early childhood  
- **Dose 2** later in childhood (often before school)

<Aside title="Local schedules differ" variant="info">
Use your country’s official immunization schedule for exact ages and catch-up intervals. The key concept is **2 documented doses** for most people.
</Aside>

## Catch-Up Vaccination
Consider catch-up if:
- You never received MMR  
- You received only one dose  
- You can’t find records and don’t have proof of immunity  

In many settings, clinicians treat “no records” as “not vaccinated” and proceed with catch-up vaccination.

## Outbreak Situations
During outbreaks, public health advice may include:
- Accelerating second doses for eligible children  
- Vaccinating susceptible adults  
- Targeted vaccination in schools, shelters, or high-risk communities  

## Effectiveness
Typical effectiveness estimates:
- **~93%** after one dose  
- **~97%** after two doses  

Breakthrough cases tend to be **milder** and less likely to spread.

## Safety and Side Effects
Common short-term effects:
- Sore arm, mild fever, mild rash  
Less common:
- Temporary joint aches (more common in adults)

Serious reactions are rare. If you have a history of severe allergy to a vaccine component, discuss with a clinician.

## Who Should NOT Get MMR
MMR is a **live attenuated vaccine**, so it is usually avoided in:
- **Pregnancy**  
- **Severe immunocompromise** (case-by-case)

## FAQ
**Q: If I had measles as a child, do I still need MMR?**  
A: Natural infection usually provides strong immunity, but documentation can be unclear. A clinician can advise based on records and local guidance.

**Q: Can I get MMR if I’m not sure I had it?**  
A: Often yes — when in doubt and there are no contraindications, vaccination may be recommended.

**Q: Is it safe to get an extra dose?**  
A: In many cases, an additional dose is acceptable when documentation is missing, but confirm with a clinician.
