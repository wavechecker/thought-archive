## Intro
People with diabetes can experience **life-threatening emergencies** when blood sugar is too low (hypoglycemia), too high with ketones (diabetic ketoacidosis, DKA), or when vomiting/illness prevents normal control.  
Quick recognition and correct action can save lives.

## Key Points
- **Severe hypo** = unconscious, seizure, or unable to swallow → call emergency services.  
- **DKA risk** = high glucose with ketones, vomiting, or illness → urgent action needed.  
- **Never stop basal insulin**, even if not eating.  
- Always carry an **emergency kit** with glucose, glucagon, and ketone testing supplies.

## Severe Hypoglycemia (Hypo)
- **Signs**: confusion, drowsiness, seizure, unconsciousness.  
- **Do not** give food or drink if the person cannot swallow.  
- Use **glucagon** (nasal spray or injection) if available and trained.  
- **Call emergency services** immediately.  
- Once awake: give long-acting carbs (bread, biscuits, milk) and contact diabetes team.

## High Blood Glucose with Ketones
- **Hydrate** with sugar-free fluids (small sips every 5–10 minutes).  
- Give **correction insulin** as per plan.  
- Recheck blood glucose and ketones after 1–2 hours.  
- Pump users: inject correction insulin by pen/syringe and **change infusion set**.  
- **Seek urgent care** if:  
  - Blood ketones ≥ **3.0 mmol/L**  
  - Ketones continue rising despite correction  
  - Vomiting, abdominal pain, drowsiness, or rapid breathing  

---

## Vomiting or Unable to Keep Fluids Down
- Very high risk for **DKA**, even if glucose isn’t extremely high.  
- Try frequent small sips of fluid.  
- If vomiting persists or fluids not tolerated → **go to hospital immediately**.  
- **Do not stop basal insulin** — stopping insulin makes DKA worse.  

---

## Driving Safety
- If you feel low or your CGM alarms: **pull over immediately** and treat.  
- Do not resume driving until blood glucose has recovered **and** you feel well.  

---

## Emergency Kit Checklist
- Glucose tablets/gel; small juice box or soft drink  
- Glucagon (check expiry) + quick instructions  
- Glucose meter/strips or CGM  
- Blood ketone meter and strips  
- Spare pen needles/syringes and pump supplies  
- Copy of your **emergency plan + contact numbers**

## FAQ
**Q: When should I call an ambulance for high blood sugar?**  
A: If you have vomiting, abdominal pain, drowsiness, rapid breathing, or ketones ≥ 3.0 mmol/L.  

**Q: Can I stop insulin if I can’t eat?**  
A: No. Always continue basal (background) insulin. Stopping increases the risk of DKA.  

**Q: What if I don’t have glucagon available?**  
A: Call emergency services immediately and put the person in the recovery position until help arrives.
