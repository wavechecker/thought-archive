## Intro
Suicide is a major global public health challenge, claiming **over 700,000 lives each year**. It is the **third leading cause of death among young people (15â€“29 years old)**. The hopeful truth: suicide is often preventable. With timely support, evidence-based interventions, and stronger communities, lives can be saved.

## Key Points
- Suicide causes more deaths than war or homicide each year.  
- Risk factors include depression, substance misuse, trauma, and isolation.  
- Warning signs include withdrawal, hopelessness, and talk of self-harm.  
- **Prevention strategies work**: crisis hotlines, reducing access to means, and integrated care.  
- Support for survivors and families is essential to healing.

## Background
Suicide is rarely the result of a single cause. It arises from complex interactions of mental health conditions, life stressors, biological vulnerability, and social context. Stigma often silences those in need, but effective prevention strategies can reduce risk significantly.

## Causes or Mechanisms
- **Mental health conditions:** depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, substance misuse.  
- **Life stressors:** relationship breakdown, financial hardship, bullying, discrimination.  
- **Biological:** genetic predisposition, neurochemical imbalances.  
- **Cultural/social:** stigma, lack of access to care, exposure to suicide in community or media.

- **Hospitalization:** in acute crisis, ensures safety and intensive treatment.  

### Support systems
- **Family and peer support:** listening non-judgmentally, encouraging professional help.
