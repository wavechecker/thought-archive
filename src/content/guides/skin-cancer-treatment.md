## Overview
Treatment of skin cancer depends on the **type and stage**. Most cases are cured with surgery, but advanced melanomas may require systemic therapy.

---

## Key Points
- **Surgery** is the main treatment for most skin cancers.  
- **Mohs surgery** is highly effective for facial or recurrent cancers.  
- **Topical creams** may be used for very superficial cancers.  
- **Radiotherapy** can be an alternative when surgery isn’t feasible.  
- **Immunotherapy and targeted therapy** are options for advanced melanoma.  

---

## Main Treatments
1. **Surgery:** Excision, curettage, or Mohs surgery.  
2. **Topical therapy:** 5-FU or imiquimod creams for early lesions.  
3. **Radiotherapy:** External beam radiation for inoperable or recurrent tumors.  
4. **Systemic therapy:**  
   - Immunotherapy (checkpoint inhibitors)  
   - Targeted drugs (BRAF/MEK inhibitors for melanoma)
