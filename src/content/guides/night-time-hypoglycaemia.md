## Intro
Night-time hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar during sleep) is common in people using insulin. It can disrupt sleep, raise morning glucose (rebound), and increase fear of going low. The goal is **fast treatment now** and **pattern-based prevention**.

## Key Points
- Treat immediately with **fast carbs**; recheck in **15 minutes**.
- Common triggers: **excess evening insulin**, **late exercise**, **alcohol**, **missed/low-carb meals**.
- Prevent with **dose timing/size adjustments**, **bedtime snacks when indicated**, and **CGM alerts**.
- Repeated nocturnal lows → **review your regimen** with your diabetes team.

## Symptoms (may occur during sleep or on waking)
- Night sweats, vivid dreams, headache, restless sleep.
- Waking confused, shaky, hungry, or with pounding heart.
- Morning high glucose (possible **rebound** after an untreated low).

## Immediate Treatment (Rule of 15)
1. Take **15–20 g fast-acting carbs** (glucose tabs/gel, juice).  
2. **Recheck in 15 minutes**.  
3. If still < **3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL)**, repeat step 1.  
4. Once recovering, if **next meal >1 hour away**, add a **slow carb** (toast/crackers).  
5. If unconscious or unable to swallow: a trained person should give **glucagon** (nasal spray or injection) and call emergency services.

> Avoid chocolate/foods high in fat for initial treatment—they’re slower to raise glucose.

## Common Causes at Night
- **Too much basal insulin** (MDI or pump) or long-acting taken too late.
- **Evening/late exercise** increasing insulin sensitivity for hours afterwards.
- **Alcohol** blunting the liver’s glucose release overnight.
- **Missed or very low-carb evening meal/bolus mismatch**.
- **Recent illness** or weight loss changing insulin needs.

## Prevention Strategies
- **Basal review:** If lows occur at similar times, discuss **reducing basal** (MDI) or set **temporary lower basal** on pumps overnight (e.g., −10% to −30%).  
- **Bolus timing:** Avoid stacking rapid-acting insulin close to bedtime.  
- **Bedtime snack (when indicated):** If trending down or exercised that evening, take a snack with **carb + protein**.  
- **Exercise planning:** Hard evening sessions? Consider lower basal/bolus and a snack; monitor more often.  
- **Alcohol:** Eat carbs with drinks; check before bed and overnight; set higher alerts.  
- **Sick-day rules:** Adjust with guidance; needs may vary.

## CGM & Alarms
- Set **low alerts** (and optional **predictive** alerts) slightly higher overnight (e.g., 4.4–5.0 mmol/L / 80–90 mg/dL).  
- Use **repeat alerts** and **share** features if available.  
- Review **night graphs** to identify patterns (time-of-night dips).

## When to Seek Medical Advice
- **Two or more nocturnal lows per week**, or any severe episode needing help.
- Frequent morning highs after suspected overnight lows.
- New job/schedule, medication, or health change affecting control.

## FAQ
**Is the morning high always a rebound from a low?**  
Not always—could be the **dawn phenomenon**. Check a CGM trace or set an alarm for a 3 a.m. finger-stick to distinguish.

**Should I always eat before bed?**  
Only if indicated (downward trend, recent exercise, or previous nocturnal lows). Unnecessary snacks can raise A1C.

**Are automated pump systems helpful?**  
Hybrid closed-loop systems can reduce nocturnal lows by adjusting basal in real time; discuss options with your team.
