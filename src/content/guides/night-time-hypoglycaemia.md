# Night-time Hypoglycaemia (Nocturnal Lows)

Night-time hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar during sleep) is common in people using insulin. It can disrupt sleep, cause morning highs (rebound), and increase fear of going low.  
The goal is **treat fast** and **prevent recurrence**.

---

## 🚑 Bottom Line
- Treat immediately if < **3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL)**.  
- Use **15 g fast carbs → recheck in 15 minutes**.  
- If unconscious or unable to swallow → **glucagon + call emergency services**.  
- Recurrent night-time lows → review insulin regimen with your team.  

---

## Symptoms (overnight or on waking)
- Night sweats, vivid dreams, headache, restless sleep.  
- Waking shaky, hungry, confused, or with a pounding heart.  
- Morning high glucose (possible rebound after untreated low).  

---

## Immediate Treatment — Rule of 15
1. Take **15–20 g fast-acting carbs** (glucose tabs/gel, juice).  
2. **Recheck in 15 minutes**.  
3. If still < **3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL)**, repeat step 1.  
4. If the next meal is >1 hour away, add a **slow carb** (toast/crackers).  
5. ⚠️ If unconscious or unable to swallow: a trained person should give **glucagon** (nasal or injection) and call **emergency services**.  

> Avoid chocolate or other high-fat foods for initial treatment — they act too slowly.

## Common Causes at Night
- **Excess basal insulin** (too high dose or taken too late).  
- **Evening/late exercise** increasing insulin sensitivity for hours afterwards.  
- **Alcohol** blunting the liver’s glucose release overnight.  
- **Missed or very low-carb evening meal**, or bolus mismatch.  
- **Illness or weight loss** changing insulin needs.  

---

## Prevention Strategies
- **Basal review**: If lows occur at consistent times, discuss reducing basal dose (MDI) or set a temporary lower basal on pumps (e.g., −10% to −30%).  
- **Bolus timing**: Avoid stacking rapid-acting insulin close to bedtime.  
- **Bedtime snack (when indicated)**: If trending down, exercised, or had alcohol, take carb + protein.  
- **Exercise planning**: After hard evening activity, consider lower basal/bolus and snack; monitor overnight.  
- **Alcohol safety**: Eat carbs with drinks, check before bed, and set higher alerts.  
- **CGM alarms**: Set overnight low alerts slightly higher (4.4–5.0 mmol/L / 80–90 mg/dL); use repeat/predictive alerts.

## When to Seek Medical Advice
- Two or more nocturnal lows per week, or **any severe hypo** needing assistance.  
- Frequent morning highs after suspected overnight lows.  
- New job, schedule, or medication changes affecting control.  

---

## FAQ
**Is a morning high always a rebound from a low?**  
No — sometimes it’s the **dawn phenomenon**. Use CGM or a 3 a.m. finger-stick to tell the difference.  

**Should I always eat before bed?**  
No. Only if trending down, had evening exercise, or previous nocturnal lows. Unnecessary snacks can raise HbA1c.  

**Do automated pumps help?**  
Hybrid closed-loop systems can reduce nocturnal lows by adjusting basal in real time.
