## Intro
GLP-1 medications are often described as “surgery without surgery.” This guide compares GLP-1 therapy and bariatric surgery across **weight loss, reversibility, risk, and long-term outcomes**.

<StratBox title="Decision Framing" level="high">
GLP-1 therapy and bariatric surgery are not interchangeable. Surgery offers greater durability but higher irreversibility, while GLP-1 therapy trades permanence for long-term uncertainty.
</StratBox>

## Key Points
- Bariatric surgery produces greater average weight loss
- GLP-1 therapy is pharmacologically reversible
- Nutrient deficiencies differ in severity and mechanism
- Long-term outcome data favors surgery (for now)

## Weight Loss Outcomes
- **GLP-1 therapy:** ~10–20% total body weight  
- **Bariatric surgery:** 25–35% or more  

Surgery generally offers greater durability in severe obesity, especially with strong follow-up.

## Risk Profiles

### GLP-1 therapy (common and important)
- Gastrointestinal symptoms
- Gallbladder disease risk with rapid weight loss
- Lean mass loss (especially without resistance training)

### Bariatric surgery (common and important)
- Perioperative and postoperative complications
- Permanent anatomical changes
- Lifelong micronutrient monitoring and supplementation

## Reversibility
GLP-1 medications can be discontinued. Bariatric surgery permanently alters gastrointestinal anatomy, though some procedures can be revised.

## Long-Term Outcomes
Bariatric surgery has decades of long-term outcome data, including improvements in metabolic disease and survival in appropriate candidates. Comparable long-term GLP-1 outcome data is still emerging at population scale.

## Evidence Summary
**Source:** Long-term surgical cohorts vs newer pharmacotherapy outcomes  
**Last updated:** 2026-01-14

- Bariatric surgery has decades of durability and long-term outcome evidence in severe obesity.
- GLP-1 therapy has strong short-to-midterm effectiveness data, but population-scale long-term outcome duration is shorter.
- Reversibility differs: stopping a medication is not equivalent to reversing an anatomic procedure.

## FAQ
**Q: Is GLP-1 therapy safer than bariatric surgery?**  
A: GLP-1 therapy often has lower short-term procedural risk, but long-term comparisons depend on obesity severity, comorbidities, and durability goals.

**Q: Is bariatric surgery reversible?**  
A: Not fully. Surgery permanently changes anatomy, even if revisions are possible.
