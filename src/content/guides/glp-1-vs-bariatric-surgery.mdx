## Intro
GLP-1 medications are often described as “surgery without surgery.” This guide compares the two approaches across **weight loss, reversibility, and long-term outcomes**.

<StratBox title="Decision Framing" level="high">
GLP-1 therapy and bariatric surgery are not interchangeable. Surgery offers greater durability but higher irreversibility, while GLP-1 therapy trades permanence for long-term uncertainty.
</StratBox>

## Key Points
- Bariatric surgery produces greater average weight loss  
- GLP-1 therapy is pharmacologically reversible  
- Nutrient deficiencies differ in severity and mechanism  
- Long-term mortality data favors surgery  

## Weight Loss Outcomes
- **GLP-1 therapy:** ~10–20% total body weight  
- **Bariatric surgery:** 25–35% or more  

## Risk Profiles

### GLP-1 Therapy
- Gastrointestinal symptoms  
- Gallbladder disease  
- Lean mass loss  

### Bariatric Surgery
- Surgical complications  
- Permanent anatomical changes  
- Lifelong micronutrient supplementation  

## Reversibility
GLP-1 medications can be discontinued. Bariatric surgery permanently alters gastrointestinal anatomy.

## Long-Term Outcomes
Bariatric surgery has decades of outcome and mortality data. Comparable long-term GLP-1 data is still emerging.

## FAQ
**Q: Is GLP-1 safer than surgery?**  
A: Often in the short term, but long-term comparisons remain incomplete.
