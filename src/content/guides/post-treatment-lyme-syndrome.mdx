## Intro
Post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS) describes ongoing symptoms such as fatigue, pain, and cognitive difficulties that persist after appropriate treatment for Lyme disease.

## Key Points
- PTLDS is recognised in guidelines as a real post-infectious syndrome.  
- Well-designed studies have not consistently shown ongoing active *Borrelia* infection in PTLDS.  
- Long-term or repeated antibiotic courses do not show sustained benefit and carry risks.  
- Management focuses on symptom control, function, and psychological support.

## Background
A minority of people treated for Lyme disease have symptoms that persist for months or longer. This has led to debate and frustration for patients and clinicians.

## Causes or Mechanisms
The exact mechanisms remain unclear. Hypotheses include:
- Immune dysregulation or persistent inflammation  
- Neural/central sensitisation of pain and fatigue pathways  
- Overlap with other post-infectious syndromes and mood disorders  

## Diagnosis / Treatment / Options
PTLDS is a clinical diagnosis made after:
- Documented Lyme disease  
- Appropriate antibiotic treatment  
- Excluding other causes of symptoms  

Management includes:
- Validating the patient’s experience and concerns  
- Addressing sleep, mood, and pain  
- Pacing and graded return to activity tailored to the individual  
- Avoiding unproven, potentially harmful long-term antibiotic regimens  

## Risks / Benefits / Prognosis
Many people improve gradually over time, but symptoms can be prolonged. Multidisciplinary support (primary care, rehabilitation, psychology) can help function and quality of life.

## FAQ
**Q: Does PTLDS mean the infection is still present?**  
A: Evidence generally does not support ongoing infection in PTLDS. It is considered a post-infectious syndrome.

**Q: Are there biomarkers for PTLDS?**  
A: No validated specific biomarkers currently exist; research is ongoing.
