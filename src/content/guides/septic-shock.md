faq:
  - q: "How is septic shock different from sepsis?"
    a: "In septic shock, blood pressure stays dangerously low despite IV fluids, requiring vasopressors and intensive care."
  - q: "What treatments are urgent?"
    a: "Rapid IV antibiotics (ideally within 1 hour), aggressive IV fluids, vasopressors, oxygen/ventilation support, and source control (e.g., drainage, device removal, surgery)."
  - q: "What is the outlook?"
    a: "Mortality is high but improves with early recognition and guideline-based care; survivors may face long-term physical and cognitive effects."

## Intro
Septic shock is a **medical emergency** and the most severe end of the sepsis spectrum. It requires rapid, protocolized care in an ICU setting.

## Key Points
- Defined by **persistent hypotension** after fluids + **need for vasopressors** and **elevated lactate**.  
- Early **antibiotics, fluids, and source control** save lives.  
- Complications: multi-organ failure, ARDS, DIC, death.  
- Survivors may experience **post-sepsis syndrome** (fatigue, cognitive issues, PTSD-like symptoms).

## Background
Sepsis arises from a dysregulated host response to infection. In septic shock, circulatory collapse and cellular dysfunction lead to critical hypoperfusion and organ failure.

## Causes or Mechanisms
Common sources: **pneumonia, urinary tract, abdominal and skin/soft tissue** infections; invasive devices can seed bloodstream infection.

## Diagnosis / Treatment / Options
**Diagnosis:** clinical sepsis plus hypotension after fluids; labs often show elevated lactate and organ dysfunction.  
**Treatment (bundled):**  
- **Within 1 hour:** cultures (if feasible) **without delaying antibiotics**, broad-spectrum IV antibiotics.  
- **Resuscitation:** IV crystalloids; **vasopressors** (e.g., norepinephrine) to maintain MAP ≥65 mmHg.  
- **Support:** oxygen/ventilation, renal support as needed.  
- **Source control:** drain abscesses, remove infected lines, surgery if indicated.

## Risks / Benefits / Prognosis
Mortality remains significant; rapid, guideline-driven care reduces death and disability.

## FAQ
**Q: Can septic shock be prevented?**  
A: Preventing and promptly treating infections (vaccination, hygiene, early care for pneumonia/UTI, safe device use) lowers risk.
