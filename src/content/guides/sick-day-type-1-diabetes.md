# Sick-Day Management for Type 1 Diabetes

Being unwell places extra stress on the body, and infections, fever, or even minor illnesses can quickly affect blood glucose levels. “Sick-day rules” are a set of steps that help you manage Type 1 diabetes safely during illness and reduce the risk of serious complications like diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

---

## Core Rules
- **Never stop basal insulin** — your body still needs background insulin, even if you are not eating.  
- **Check blood glucose more often** — every 2–4 hours (including overnight if unwell).  
- **Check ketones** whenever blood glucose is high (> 13–15 mmol/L) *or* if you feel unwell.  
- Follow your personalised **sick-day action plan** if you have one from your diabetes team.  

---

## Fluids & Carbohydrates
- Stay hydrated with frequent small sips of water or sugar-free fluids.  
- If you cannot eat normally, take in **sick-day carb options** such as fruit juice, regular soft drink, honey, jelly, or glucose powder/tablets — these provide energy and help prevent ketosis.  
- Aim for ~50 g carbs every 3–4 hours if unable to manage normal meals.  

---

## Insulin Adjustments
- Illness often raises insulin needs due to stress hormones.  
- Follow your plan for **correction doses** (injections) or **temporary basal increases** (pump).  
- If you are vomiting, or glucose levels stay high despite extra insulin, contact your diabetes team early.  
- Keep detailed notes of insulin doses, blood glucose, ketone results, and fluids taken.  

---

## Red Flags — Seek Urgent Medical Care
Call emergency services or go to hospital if you have:
- **Ketones ≥ 3.0 mmol/L**, or rising ketones despite insulin and fluids.  
- **Persistent vomiting** or inability to keep fluids down.  
- **Abdominal pain, rapid breathing, fruity breath, or drowsiness** (possible DKA).  
- **Severe dehydration** (sunken eyes, very little urine, extreme thirst).  

---

## Extra Tips
- Keep a **sick-day kit** stocked: ketone strips, glucose tablets, rehydration drinks, insulin supplies, thermometer, and contact numbers.  
- Inform close family, friends, or colleagues about your sick-day plan so they can assist if needed.  
- Review your sick-day rules annually with your diabetes team — update if your insulin regimen or devices change.

## FAQ

**Q: Should I stop insulin if I’m not eating?**  
A: No. Always continue basal insulin. Stopping insulin completely is dangerous and can trigger DKA.  

**Q: How do I manage nausea or vomiting?**  
A: Take small sips of fluid every few minutes, use carb-containing fluids if not eating, and monitor ketones closely. Seek help early if you can’t keep fluids down.  

**Q: Can illness cause blood glucose to go low instead of high?**  
A: Yes, especially if you are eating less. This is why frequent testing and adjusting insulin with guidance from your plan or team is essential.

⚠️ **Remember:** Sick-days carry higher risks for people with Type 1 diabetes.  
Never stop insulin, keep checking glucose and ketones, stay hydrated, and **seek medical help early if you are unable to control levels or keep fluids down**.
