# Mindfulness and Stress Reduction

*[← Back to Toolkit](/guides/mental-health-toolkit)*

Mindfulness is the practice of paying attention, non-judgmentally, to the present moment. It helps calm the mind, regulate emotion, and reduce stress.

## Benefits

- Reduces **stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms**  
- Improves focus and emotional regulation  
- Strengthens coping skills for difficult thoughts  

---

## Practices to Try

- **Mindful breathing:** follow the breath for 5–10 minutes  
- **Body scan:** notice tension and release it  
- **Mindful walking or eating:** engage fully with sensory details

## How Much?

Even **10 minutes per day** can make a measurable difference.  

Mindfulness is not a quick fix, but when practiced consistently, it rewires stress responses and improves resilience.
