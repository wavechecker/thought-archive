Insulin delivery comes down to two things: **the type of insulin** you're using, and **the device you use to inject it**. Get both right and daily management becomes more predictable and safer.

## 1. Insulin Types

> Names vary by country — check what's available locally.

- **Ultra-rapid/rapid-acting (bolus):** lispro (*Humalog, Lyumjev*), aspart (*NovoRapid/Novolog, Fiasp*), glulisine (*Apidra*).  
  *Onset:* 5–15 min · *Peak:* ~1 hr · *Duration:* 3–5 hrs.

- **Short-acting (regular):** Actrapid, Humulin R, Novolin R.  
  *Onset:* ~30 min · *Peak:* 2–3 hrs · *Duration:* 6–8 hrs.

- **Intermediate:** NPH (*Protaphane, Humulin N*).  
  *Onset:* 1–2 hrs · *Peak:* 4–10 hrs · *Duration:* 12–18 hrs.

- **Long/ultra-long (basal):** glargine (*Lantus, Basaglar, Toujeo*), detemir (*Levemir*), degludec (*Tresiba*).  
  *Onset:* 1–2 hrs · *Duration:* 20–42+ hrs, flatter profile.

- **Premixed:** fixed ratios of rapid or regular + NPH (e.g. 70/30, 75/25). Less flexible, fewer injections.

- **Concentrated:** lispro U-200, degludec U-200, glargine U-300, regular U-500. Always match pens/syringes carefully.

## 2. Delivery Methods

### Pens
- Accurate dosing, portable, fine needles (4–6 mm).  
- Prime 1–2 units before injection.  
- Inject at 90°, hold 10 sec, rotate sites to avoid lumps.

### Syringes
- Cheapest option, flexible for unusual doses.  
- Draw **clear before cloudy** when mixing rapid + NPH.  
- Rotate sites the same way as pens.

### Pumps (CSII & AID systems)
- Continuous basal delivery + bolus dosing.  
- Allows temp basal for exercise/illness.  
- With CGM, can automate adjustments (AID).  
- **Risks:** infusion set failure = fast rise in ketones.  
- Change sets every 2–3 days, sooner in heat.

## 3. Safety & Practical Tips
- **Hypo plan:** always carry fast carbs; recheck in 15 min; follow with slower carbs.  
- **Illness/sick days:** never stop basal; check ketones when high or unwell.  
- **Storage:** unopened insulin in fridge (2–8 °C); in-use pens/vials at room temp (check expiry window). Avoid heat/freeze.  
- **Driving:** check BGL before driving; don't drive if low until recovered.  
- **Units:** concentrated insulins (U-200/U-300) still dose in *units* — don't transfer from pens to syringes.
