## Intro
Insulin therapy is central to diabetes management, especially for people with type 1 diabetes and some with type 2. Understanding the different insulin types helps patients, carers, and clinicians tailor treatment to individual needs.

## Key Points
- Four main categories: **rapid-acting, short-acting, intermediate-acting, long-acting**.  
- They differ by **onset**, **peak**, and **duration**.  
- Often used in combination to mimic natural insulin release.  
- Delivery methods: injection pens, pumps, or syringes.

## Types of Insulin

### Rapid-acting
- **Examples:** Lispro (Humalog), Aspart (NovoRapid), Glulisine (Apidra).  
- **Onset:** 10–20 minutes.  
- **Peak:** 1–3 hours.  
- **Duration:** 3–5 hours.  
- **Use:** Taken at mealtimes to cover blood sugar rise.

### Short-acting (Regular)
- **Examples:** Humulin R, Actrapid.  
- **Onset:** 30 minutes.  
- **Peak:** 2–4 hours.  
- **Duration:** 6–8 hours.  
- **Use:** Mealtime coverage; must inject 30 minutes before eating.

### Intermediate-acting
- **Examples:** NPH (Humulin N, Insulatard).  
- **Onset:** 1–2 hours.  
- **Peak:** 4–12 hours.  
- **Duration:** 12–18 hours.  
- **Use:** Often combined with short- or rapid-acting insulin.

### Long-acting (Basal)
- **Examples:** Glargine (Lantus, Toujeo), Detemir (Levemir), Degludec (Tresiba).  
- **Onset:** 1–2 hours.  
- **Duration:** Up to 24–42 hours depending on preparation.  
- **Use:** Provides baseline insulin between meals and overnight.

## Delivery Methods
- **Pens:** Most common, prefilled, dose dial.  
- **Syringes:** Less common, may still be used in some regions.  
- **Pumps:** Provide continuous basal insulin, with programmable boluses at mealtimes.  

## Risks & Considerations
- Main risk: **hypoglycemia** (low blood sugar).  
- Weight gain is possible with some insulins.  
- Rotation of injection sites helps prevent lipodystrophy.  
- Dosing must be individualized by a clinician.  

## FAQ
**Q: What’s the difference between rapid-acting and short-acting?**  
Rapid-acting works faster and is taken right at mealtime; short-acting is slower and must be taken earlier.

**Q: Can long-acting insulin replace mealtime insulin?**  
No. Long-acting covers baseline needs; mealtime spikes require rapid or short-acting insulin.

**Q: Are biosimilar insulins safe?**  
Yes, biosimilars undergo rigorous testing and are equally effective.
