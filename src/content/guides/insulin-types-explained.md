Insulin isn’t one single medicine — it comes in different types, each working at a different speed. Understanding these differences helps you match insulin to your lifestyle, meals, and blood glucose patterns.

**Types of Insulin:**
- **Rapid-Acting** – Works within 10–20 minutes, peaks at 1–3 hours, lasts 3–5 hours.
- **Short-Acting** – Starts in 30–60 minutes, peaks at 2–5 hours, lasts up to 8 hours.
- **Intermediate-Acting** – Onset 1–2 hours, peaks at 4–12 hours, lasts up to 18 hours.
- **Long-Acting** – Slow, steady release over 24 hours or more; no pronounced peak.

**Choosing the Right Type:**
Your healthcare provider may prescribe a mix — e.g., long-acting for baseline coverage plus rapid-acting with meals.
