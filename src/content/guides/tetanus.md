# Tetanus — When to Get a Booster

## Intro
Tetanus is a rare but life-threatening bacterial disease caused by *Clostridium tetani*. The bacteria release a toxin that affects the nervous system, causing painful muscle spasms, lockjaw, breathing problems, and often death if untreated.  
Vaccination and timely boosters are the best protection.

## Key Points
- Adults need a **routine booster every 10 years**.  
- If more than **5 years since last dose** and a dirty or high-risk wound occurs, an additional booster is recommended.  
- Childhood protection begins with **DTaP** vaccines in infancy, with Tdap boosters in adolescence and adulthood.  
- **Maternal vaccination** during pregnancy protects newborns from neonatal tetanus.  

## Background
- **History:** Tetanus toxoid vaccines were introduced in the 1920s and became widespread after WWII, nearly eliminating the disease in high-income countries.  
- **Transmission:** Tetanus is not contagious; spores live in soil and enter through cuts, punctures, or burns.  
- **Global picture:** Routine vaccination and maternal programs have sharply reduced neonatal tetanus, but thousands of cases still occur in regions with low coverage.  

## Evidence
- **Effectiveness:** Near 100% protection with full vaccination and boosters.  
- **Population data:** In high-coverage countries, tetanus is extremely rare. In low-resource settings, neonatal tetanus remains a serious problem.  
- **Safety:** Tetanus vaccines have a long safety record; adverse effects are usually mild (injection site pain, low-grade fever).  

## Risks / Benefits
- **Benefits:** Prevents a disease with a very high fatality rate; enables elimination of neonatal tetanus when maternal coverage is high.  
- **Risks:** Most adverse effects are mild and temporary. Serious reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis) are extremely rare.  
- **Myths:** No evidence supports long-term risks such as infertility or autoimmune disease.  

## Global Recommendations
- **WHO:** Childhood vaccination (as part of DTP/DTaP schedule), with school-age, adolescent, and adult boosters. Maternal tetanus vaccination protects newborns.  
- **CDC (US):** Tdap at 11–12 years, then Td/Tdap booster every 10 years. Extra dose if wound and >5 years since last shot.  
- **ATAGI (Australia):** Routine doses at 2, 4, 6 months; 4 years; adolescence; and adult boosters every 10 years.  

## FAQ
**Q: What if I don’t know when I had my last tetanus shot?**  
A: If you have a high-risk wound and it’s unclear, a booster is recommended.  

**Q: Is tetanus contagious?**  
A: No. It is acquired from the environment, not from other people.  

**Q: Do I still need boosters if I was vaccinated as a child?**  
A: Yes. Immunity wanes, so adult boosters are required.  

**Q: Why is neonatal tetanus still a problem in some countries?**  
A: Gaps in maternal vaccination and unhygienic birth practices.
