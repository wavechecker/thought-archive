# When to Seek Emergency Help for Chest Pain

Chest pain can be harmless (muscle strain, heartburn) or a sign of something serious. Use this guide to decide when to act fast.

## Red flags — call emergency services now
- **Pressure, tightness, or heaviness** in the center of the chest lasting >5–10 minutes  
- Pain **spreading** to arm, jaw, neck, back, or shoulders  
- **Shortness of breath**, cold sweat, nausea, or lightheadedness  
- Chest pain **at rest** or waking you from sleep  
- New chest pain in people with **heart disease, diabetes, or risk factors** (smoking, high BP, high cholesterol)  
- Chest pain with **fainting** or **severe weakness**

## Possible causes (not exhaustive)
- **Heart:** heart attack (myocardial infarction), angina, pericarditis  
- **Lungs:** pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, pneumonia  
- **GI/muscle:** reflux/heartburn, esophageal spasm, costochondritis, muscle strain

## What to do while waiting for help
- Rest; **do not drive yourself**  
- If not allergic and no contraindications, **chew 1 adult aspirin (300–325 mg)**  
- Keep a list of medicines and allergies handy

## When it’s probably not urgent
- Brief, sharp pain that worsens with touch or twisting and **goes away quickly**  
- Reproducible muscle tenderness after activity  
Even then, discuss with a clinician if it **keeps returning**.

## FAQ
**Is heart pain always severe?** No—many heart attacks feel like pressure, not stabbing pain.  
**If symptoms improve, can I skip care?** No—**get checked**; symptoms can wax and wane.
