## Intro

Completing treatment for bowel cancer is a major milestone. Survivorship focuses on monitoring for recurrence, managing side effects, and supporting long-term physical and emotional recovery.

---

## Key Points

- Regular follow-up reduces risk of missed recurrence.
- Side effects can persist after treatment.
- Lifestyle changes support long-term health.
- Psychological recovery is important.

---

## Follow-Up Care

Monitoring may include:

- Regular clinical review
- Blood tests (including CEA)
- Colonoscopy
- Imaging in some cases

Follow-up schedules vary by stage.

---

## Long-Term Effects

Possible long-term effects include:

- Bowel habit changes
- Fatigue
- Neuropathy (after chemotherapy)
- Sexual or urinary changes

Support is available — these issues are common.

---

## Recurrence Risk

Risk depends on initial stage and tumor characteristics.

Regular follow-up is essential during the first 3–5 years after treatment.

---

## Emotional Recovery

Anxiety about recurrence is common.

Support groups, counseling, and structured survivorship plans can help.
