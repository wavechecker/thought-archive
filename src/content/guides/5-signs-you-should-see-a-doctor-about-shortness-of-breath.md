Shortness of breath (dyspnoea) can happen after intense exercise or during times of stress — but when it occurs unexpectedly, worsens, or doesn’t resolve with rest, it may signal a serious health problem.  
Here are **five warning signs** you shouldn’t ignore:

1. **Sudden onset without clear cause**  
   If you’re resting or doing light activity and suddenly feel breathless, it could point to a heart, lung, or blood clot emergency.

2. **Worsening over days or weeks**  
   Gradual decline in your ability to breathe comfortably may be a sign of asthma, COPD, heart failure, or anaemia.

3. **Associated chest pain or tightness**  
   Pain, heaviness, or pressure in the chest alongside breathlessness warrants urgent assessment to rule out heart attack or pulmonary embolism.

4. **Blue lips or fingertips**  
   A bluish tint suggests low oxygen levels in the blood — a potential medical emergency.

5. **Interference with daily activities**  
   If climbing stairs, walking short distances, or speaking in full sentences becomes difficult, it’s time to get checked.

**Bottom line:** Seek prompt medical advice for any unexplained, persistent, or severe shortness of breath. Call emergency services immediately if symptoms come on suddenly or with chest pain, dizziness, or fainting.
