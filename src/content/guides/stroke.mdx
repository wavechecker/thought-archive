# Stroke: Act Fast — Treatment Has Improved, But Time Still Matters

A **stroke** is a medical emergency caused by interrupted blood flow to the brain. Without oxygen, brain cells begin to die within minutes.

**Fast recognition and emergency response can save a life — and reduce disability.**

The good news: modern stroke systems can treat **more people than ever before**, including some who arrive later than the old “cut-offs.”  
The rule that never changes: **if you suspect a stroke, call emergency services immediately.**

---

## The FAST Test

Remember **FAST**:

- **F — Face:** drooping or numbness on one side  
- **A — Arms:** weakness or inability to raise both arms evenly  
- **S — Speech:** slurred, confused, or strange speech  
- **T — Time:** call emergency services **immediately**

Do **not** wait to see if symptoms improve.

## Other Stroke Symptoms You Should Never Ignore

Call emergency services if you notice:

- Sudden **vision changes** (blurred, double, or loss of sight)
- Sudden **confusion** or trouble understanding speech
- Sudden **numbness or weakness** in face/arm/leg (especially on one side)
- Sudden **loss of balance**, severe dizziness, or coordination problems
- Sudden, severe **headache** with no known cause

<ExplainerBox title="What’s Changed in Stroke Care?" icon="🧠">
  <p><strong>Stroke treatment has improved — but speed is still critical.</strong></p>

  <p>
    Many hospitals now use rapid brain imaging and streamlined protocols to identify who may benefit from
    clot-busting medication or clot removal. This means:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>More people are eligible for treatment than in the past</li>
    <li>Some patients can be treated even if they arrive later than the “classic” windows</li>
    <li>Emergency response is still the #1 factor you control</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    You do not need to know which treatment applies. Your job is to get emergency help immediately.

## If Symptoms Go Away, It’s STILL an Emergency (TIA / “Mini-Stroke”)

A **Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)** causes stroke-like symptoms that resolve within minutes to hours.

Important:
- A TIA is **not harmless**
- It is a **strong warning sign** of a future stroke
- Many major strokes occur **within days** of a TIA

Even if symptoms disappear, **urgent medical assessment can prevent a larger stroke**.

## Stroke Treatment Timing: What Patients Should Know

Doctors use the time the person was **last known well** (the last moment they were definitely normal) plus brain imaging to choose treatments.

### 1) Clot-busting medication (thrombolysis)
- Works best when given **as soon as possible**
- Commonly used within **4.5 hours** of last known well
- In selected cases, advanced imaging may support treatment beyond **4.5 hours** (for example, some “wake-up” strokes or late presenters)

### 2) Clot removal (thrombectomy)
- Used for some strokes caused by a **large vessel blockage**
- Can be effective in the early hours
- In selected patients, may be considered up to **24 hours** from last known well, based on imaging and clinical factors

**Key takeaway:** Don’t self-triage based on the clock. **Call immediately.** Let stroke specialists decide what’s possible.

---

## Why Doctors Ask “When Did This Start?”

Because treatments depend on:
- when symptoms began (or last known well)
- what brain imaging shows
- overall safety and benefit

If you’re with someone having a stroke:
- note the exact time symptoms started (or when they were last seen normal)
- tell emergency staff immediately

---

## Stroke Can Happen at Any Age (Including Children)

Stroke can occur in:
- older adults
- young adults
- children (rare, but real)

If a child has sudden weakness, speech trouble, severe confusion, or collapse, treat it as an emergency.

---

## What To Do While Waiting for Help

- Stay with the person and keep them calm
- Keep them safe (sitting or lying down)
- Do **not** give food, drink, or medication
- Note the **time symptoms began / last known well**

---

## Prevention: Reduce Your Stroke Risk

- Control **blood pressure**
- Manage **cholesterol** and **diabetes**
- Don’t smoke
- Exercise regularly
- Take prescribed medications exactly as directed (especially blood pressure meds and blood thinners if indicated)

## Myth vs Fact

**Myth:** Stroke only happens to the elderly.  
**Fact:** Stroke can occur at **any age**, including children.

**Myth:** If symptoms disappear, it’s nothing serious.  
**Fact:** A TIA is a **medical emergency** and warning sign.

**Myth:** It’s too late if you didn’t get help immediately.  
**Fact:** Some people can still be treated later depending on imaging — but earlier is always better.

## FAQ

**Q: What should I do if I’m not sure it’s a stroke?**  
A: Treat it as a stroke anyway. **Call emergency services immediately.**

**Q: Is a “mini-stroke” really urgent if it went away?**  
A: Yes. A TIA can be a warning sign of a major stroke in the next hours or days.

**Q: What is “last known well”?**  
A: The last time the person was definitely at their normal baseline. This is often more important than when symptoms were first noticed.

**Q: Can children have strokes?**  
A: Yes. It’s rare, but it happens, and it’s an emergency.
