faq:
  - q: "What are the early signs of stroke?"
    a: "Use FAST: Face drooping, Arm weakness, Speech difficulty, Time to call emergency services. Other signs include sudden vision problems, confusion, severe dizziness, loss of coordination, or a sudden severe headache."
  - q: "What is a TIA or mini-stroke?"
    a: "A transient ischemic attack (TIA) causes stroke-like symptoms that resolve within minutes or hours. It is a medical emergency and a strong warning sign of a future stroke."
  - q: "What is the treatment time window for clot-busting medication?"
    a: "Clot-busting medication is usually most effective when started as soon as possible and is commonly used up to 4.5 hours from the time the person was last known well. In selected cases, advanced brain imaging may support treatment beyond 4.5 hours."
  - q: "How long after stroke symptoms can clot removal (thrombectomy) work?"
    a: "For some strokes caused by a large artery blockage, thrombectomy can help within the first several hours, and in selected cases up to 24 hours from last known well, depending on imaging and clinical factors."
  - q: "Can children have strokes?"
    a: "Yes. Stroke can occur at any age, including in children. It's rare but real, and it's always an emergency."

# Stroke: Act Fast — Treatment Has Improved, But Time Still Matters

A **stroke** is a medical emergency caused by interrupted blood flow to the brain. Without oxygen, brain cells begin to die within minutes.

**Fast recognition and emergency response can save a life — and reduce disability.**

The good news: modern stroke systems can treat **more people than ever before**, including some who arrive later than the old “cut-offs.”  
The rule that never changes: **if you suspect a stroke, call emergency services immediately.**

---

## The FAST Test

Remember **FAST**:

- **F — Face:** drooping or numbness on one side  
- **A — Arms:** weakness or inability to raise both arms evenly  
- **S — Speech:** slurred, confused, or strange speech  
- **T — Time:** call emergency services **immediately**

Do **not** wait to see if symptoms improve.

---

## Other Stroke Symptoms You Should Never Ignore

Call emergency services if you notice:

- Sudden **vision changes** (blurred, double, or loss of sight)
- Sudden **confusion** or trouble understanding speech
- Sudden **numbness or weakness** in face/arm/leg (especially on one side)
- Sudden **loss of balance**, severe dizziness, or coordination problems
- Sudden, severe **headache** with no known cause

  <h3>What's Changed in Stroke Care?</h3>

  <p><strong>Stroke treatment has improved — but speed is still critical.</strong></p>

  <p>
    Many hospitals now use rapid brain imaging and streamlined protocols to identify who may benefit from
    clot-busting medication or clot removal. This means:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>More people are eligible for treatment than in the past</li>
    <li>Some patients can be treated even if they arrive later than the "classic" windows</li>
    <li>Emergency response is still the #1 factor you control</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    You do not need to know which treatment applies. Your job is to get emergency help immediately.

## If Symptoms Go Away, It’s STILL an Emergency (TIA / “Mini-Stroke”)

A **Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)** causes stroke-like symptoms that resolve within minutes to hours.

Important:
- A TIA is **not harmless**
- It is a **strong warning sign** of a future stroke
- Many major strokes occur **within days** of a TIA

Even if symptoms disappear, **urgent medical assessment can prevent a larger stroke**.

---

## Stroke Treatment Timing: What Patients Should Know

Doctors use the time the person was **last known well** (the last moment they were definitely normal) plus brain imaging to choose treatments.

### 1) Clot-busting medication (thrombolysis)
- Works best when given **as soon as possible**
- Commonly used within **4.5 hours** of last known well
- In selected cases, advanced imaging may support treatment beyond **4.5 hours** (for example, some “wake-up” strokes or late presenters)

### 2) Clot removal (thrombectomy)
- Used for some strokes caused by a **large vessel blockage**
- Can be effective in the early hours
- In selected patients, may be considered up to **24 hours** from last known well, based on imaging and clinical factors

**Key takeaway:** Don’t self-triage based on the clock. **Call immediately.** Let stroke specialists decide what’s possible.

---

## Why Doctors Ask “When Did This Start?”

Because treatments depend on:
- when symptoms began (or last known well)
- what brain imaging shows
- overall safety and benefit

If you’re with someone having a stroke:
- note the exact time symptoms started (or when they were last seen normal)
- tell emergency staff immediately

---

## Stroke Can Happen at Any Age (Including Children)

Stroke can occur in:
- older adults
- young adults
- children (rare, but real)

If a child has sudden weakness, speech trouble, severe confusion, or collapse, treat it as an emergency.

---

## What To Do While Waiting for Help

- Stay with the person and keep them calm
- Keep them safe (sitting or lying down)
- Do **not** give food, drink, or medication
- Note the **time symptoms began / last known well**

---

## Prevention: Reduce Your Stroke Risk

- Control **blood pressure**
- Manage **cholesterol** and **diabetes**
- Don’t smoke
- Exercise regularly
- Take prescribed medications exactly as directed (especially blood pressure meds and blood thinners if indicated)

---

## Myth vs Fact

**Myth:** Stroke only happens to the elderly.  
**Fact:** Stroke can occur at **any age**, including children.

**Myth:** If symptoms disappear, it’s nothing serious.  
**Fact:** A TIA is a **medical emergency** and warning sign.

**Myth:** It’s too late if you didn’t get help immediately.  
**Fact:** Some people can still be treated later depending on imaging — but earlier is always better.

## FAQ

**Q: What should I do if I’m not sure it’s a stroke?**  
A: Treat it as a stroke anyway. **Call emergency services immediately.**

**Q: Is a “mini-stroke” really urgent if it went away?**  
A: Yes. A TIA can be a warning sign of a major stroke in the next hours or days.

**Q: What is “last known well”?**  
A: The last time the person was definitely at their normal baseline. This is often more important than when symptoms were first noticed.

**Q: Can children have strokes?**  
A: Yes. It’s rare, but it happens, and it’s an emergency.
