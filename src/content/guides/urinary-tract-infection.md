faq:

    a: "Uncomplicated bladder infections usually require antibiotics; your clinician will choose based on symptoms, risk factors, and local resistance patterns."
  - q: "When is it an emergency?"
    a: "If you have fever, back/flank pain, vomiting, are pregnant, or feel very unwell — seek urgent care to rule out kidney infection."
  - q: "How can I prevent UTIs?"
    a: "Hydration, urinating after sex, avoiding spermicides if prone to UTIs, and addressing vaginal estrogen deficiency after menopause can help."
  - q: "Are UTIs sexually transmitted?"
    a: "No — UTIs are not STIs, though sexual activity can trigger infections in some people."

## Intro
UTIs are common, especially in women. Most are bladder infections (cystitis) with local symptoms; **kidney infections** (pyelonephritis) cause systemic illness and require prompt treatment.

## Key Points
- Classic symptoms: **burning, urgency, frequency**; fever/flank pain suggests **kidney involvement**.  
- **Antibiotics** are first-line for most symptomatic infections; choice depends on local resistance and patient factors.  
- Red flags needing urgent care: **fever, flank pain, vomiting, pregnancy, sepsis signs**.  
- Prevention: hydration, behavioral measures, topical estrogen after menopause (if appropriate).  

## Background
Enteric bacteria (commonly *E. coli*) ascend the urethra to the bladder; risk increases with sexual activity, pregnancy, obstruction, catheters, and post-menopause changes.

## Causes or Mechanisms
Bacterial colonization and biofilm formation can promote recurrence. Structural or functional urinary tract problems increase risk.

## Diagnosis / Treatment / Options
**Diagnosis:** symptoms + urine dipstick; urine culture for atypical, recurrent, pregnant, male, or complicated cases.  
**Treatment:** short oral antibiotic courses for uncomplicated cystitis; longer courses/IV therapy for pyelonephritis; supportive care (fluids, analgesia). Consider addressing contributing factors (obstruction, catheter care).  

## Risks / Benefits / Prognosis
Most uncomplicated UTIs resolve quickly with treatment. Untreated or complicated infections can progress to kidney infection or sepsis.

## FAQ
**Q: Can cranberry help?**  
A: Evidence is mixed; some people find cranberry products reduce recurrences, but they are not a treatment for active infection.
