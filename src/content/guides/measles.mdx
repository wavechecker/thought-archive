  - q: "How contagious is measles?"
    a: "Measles is one of the most contagious viruses known. Up to 90% of unvaccinated contacts become infected after exposure."

# Measles (Rubeola)

## Intro
**Measles** is a highly contagious viral illness that spreads through the air and can remain infectious for up to **two hours** after an infected person leaves a room.

Although preventable by vaccination, measles outbreaks are resurging worldwide due to **immunity gaps**, disrupted healthcare systems, and declining vaccination coverage.

<aside class="explainer-box">
  <h3>Critical Threshold</h3>
  <p>To prevent sustained transmission, <strong>at least 95% of the population must receive two MMR doses</strong>. Even small drops below this level can trigger outbreaks.</p>
</aside>

## Key Points
- One of the **most contagious viruses** known
- Airborne transmission with prolonged environmental survival
- Serious complications including pneumonia and encephalitis
- No antiviral cure — prevention is essential
- Two-dose MMR vaccination provides ~97% protection

## Risk Stratification

**High risk:**
- Unvaccinated children
- Infants under 12 months
- Pregnant people
- Immunocompromised individuals

**Low risk:**
- Fully vaccinated adults

## The Disease
- **Transmission:** Airborne droplets and aerosols
- **Incubation period:** 7–14 days
- **Early symptoms:** Fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes
- **Classic signs:** Koplik spots followed by a spreading red rash
- **Immune effects:** Temporary immune suppression lasting months

## Complications
- Pneumonia (most common cause of death)
- Encephalitis (~1 in 1,000 cases)
- Vision and hearing loss
- **Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE)** — rare, delayed, and fatal

## The Vaccine (MMR)
- **Licensed:** 1963
- **Effectiveness:** ~93% after one dose, ~97% after two doses
- **Safety:** Excellent; serious adverse events are extremely rare
- **Population benefit:** Protects infants and vulnerable individuals via herd immunity

<aside class="explainer-box">
  <h3>MMRV Policy Update</h3>
  <p>Some advisory bodies recommend <strong>separate MMR and varicella vaccines</strong> for children under 4 years due to a slightly higher risk of febrile seizures with MMRV. MMRV remains approved and widely used.</p>
</aside>

## Why Outbreaks Are Returning
- Missed routine childhood vaccinations during COVID-19
- Conflict and population displacement
- Health system strain
- Vaccine misinformation and hesitancy
- International travel seeding new clusters

## FAQ
**Q: Can vaccinated people still get measles?**
A: Rarely. Breakthrough cases are usually mild and much less contagious.

**Q: Is measles only a childhood illness?**
A: No. Adults can become severely ill, especially if unvaccinated.

**Q: Is vitamin A useful in measles?**
A: Yes. In children, vitamin A supplementation reduces severity and mortality.
