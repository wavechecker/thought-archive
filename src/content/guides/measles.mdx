# Measles and the Measles Vaccine

## Intro
Measles is a highly contagious viral disease that can cause severe complications, including pneumonia, encephalitis, deafness, and death.  
The measles vaccine — usually given as the combined MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) or MMRV (with varicella) — is one of the safest and most effective vaccines ever developed.  

Thanks to immunisation, measles deaths have fallen dramatically, but outbreaks are returning wherever coverage drops.

<Aside title="Important" variant="warning">
Measles is so contagious that **90% of unvaccinated contacts** will be infected after exposure.  
Around **95% coverage** is needed for herd immunity to stop outbreaks.
</Aside>

## Key Points
- **Contagious:** Up to 90% of unvaccinated contacts will catch measles after exposure.  
- **Herd immunity:** ~95% coverage needed to stop outbreaks.  
- **Vaccine effectiveness:** ~97% after two doses.  
- **Impact:** Prevented an estimated 23 million deaths between 2000 and 2018.  
- **Safety:** Decades of surveillance confirm safety; no link to autism.  

## The Disease
- **Transmission:** Spread via coughing, sneezing, or breathing; virus can linger in the air up to 2 hours.  
- **Symptoms:** High fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, Koplik spots, and a spreading rash.  
- **Complications:** Pneumonia (most common cause of death), encephalitis (~1 in 1,000), SSPE (rare, fatal brain disorder years later).  
- **At risk:** Infants, pregnant women, and the immunocompromised.  

## The Vaccine
- **History:** First licensed in 1963, improved versions soon followed.  
- **Formulations:** MMR or MMRV.  
- **Effectiveness:** One dose ~93%, two doses ~97%.  
- **Safety:** Common side effects are mild (fever, rash). Rare side effects include febrile seizures; serious reactions are extremely rare.  
- **Myths:** The 1998 autism claim was fraudulent and has been thoroughly debunked.  

<Aside title="Note on MMRV Policy" variant="info">
As of September 2025, U.S. vaccine advisors have voted to **stop recommending MMRV** for children under 4 due to a small increase in febrile seizure risk.  
Children in this age group are advised to receive **separate MMR + varicella shots** instead.  
MMRV remains available and covered under the **Vaccines for Children** program.
</Aside>

## Global Recommendations
- **WHO:** Two doses for all children, first at 9–12 months, second at 15–18 months.  
- **CDC (US):** First dose 12–15 months, second at 4–6 years.  
- **ATAGI (Australia):** 12 months (MMR), 18 months (MMRV). Catch-up for unvaccinated adults.  

## Recent Outbreaks
- 2025: Texas outbreak spread to nearby states after local vaccination rates dipped.  
- Europe and Asia continue to see resurgences linked to vaccine hesitancy and healthcare disruptions.  
- International travel remains a key driver of imported cases.  

## Risks / Benefits
- **Benefits:** Prevents a disease with a case fatality rate of ~1–3 per 1,000 in high-income countries (higher in low-resource settings). Protects against severe complications and death.  
- **Risks:** Very small; overwhelmingly outweighed by benefits.  

## FAQ
**Q: Is measles just a childhood rash?**  
A: No. It can cause life-threatening illness and long-term complications.  

**Q: Can adults get measles?**  
A: Yes. Adults without immunity remain at risk. Vaccination is recommended.  

**Q: How many doses are needed for lifelong protection?**  
A: Two doses usually provide lifelong immunity.  

**Q: Why do outbreaks still occur?**  
A: Measles is so contagious that even small drops in coverage allow outbreaks.
