# Measles (Rubeola): The Disease and the Vaccine

## Intro
**Measles** is one of the most contagious viruses known — capable of infecting up to 9 out of 10 unvaccinated contacts after exposure.  
It spreads through the air and can remain suspended for up to two hours.  

The **measles vaccine** (usually given as MMR: measles, mumps, rubella) is safe, highly effective, and essential to global public health.  
Thanks to vaccination, measles deaths have fallen dramatically, but outbreaks are returning wherever coverage drops.

<Aside title="Important" variant="warning">
To stop measles transmission, **at least 95%** of the population must have two documented doses of MMR.  
Falling coverage — now ~92–93% among U.S. kindergarteners — is driving current outbreaks.
</Aside>

## Key Points
- **Extremely contagious:** One case can infect most unvaccinated contacts nearby.  
- **Vaccine effectiveness:** ~97% after two doses.  
- **Herd protection threshold:** ~95% coverage needed to stop outbreaks.  
- **Impact:** Vaccination prevented over 23 million deaths between 2000 and 2018.  
- **Safety:** Monitored for decades — no link to autism.

## The Disease
- **Transmission:** Airborne droplets and aerosols; virus survives in air up to 2 hours.  
- **Symptoms:** High fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, **Koplik spots**, and a spreading rash from face to body.  
- **Complications:** Pneumonia (leading cause of death), encephalitis (~1 in 1,000 cases), and SSPE — a rare, fatal brain disorder years later.  
- **At risk:** Infants, pregnant people, and the immunocompromised.

## The Vaccine
- **History:** Introduced in 1963, refined for higher potency and stability.  
- **Formulations:** MMR or MMRV (includes varicella).  
- **Effectiveness:** One dose ~93%; two doses ~97%.  
- **Safety:** Mild fever or rash are the most common reactions. Severe events are extremely rare.  
- **Myths:** The discredited 1998 autism paper was fraudulent and retracted.

<Aside title="Note on MMRV Policy" variant="info">
As of **September 2025**, U.S. vaccine advisors recommend **separate MMR + varicella** shots for children under 4, due to a small increased risk of febrile seizures with MMRV.  
MMRV remains available and covered under the **Vaccines for Children** program.
</Aside>

## Global Recommendations
- **WHO:** Two doses for all children — 9–12 months, then 15–18 months.  
- **CDC (U.S.):** 12–15 months, then 4–6 years.  
- **ATAGI (Australia):** 12 months (MMR), 18 months (MMRV).  
Catch-up vaccination is advised for unvaccinated adults.

## Recent Outbreaks
The **2025 U.S. outbreak** has surpassed 1,500 cases across more than two dozen states — the highest since 2019.  
Clusters are concentrated in communities with declining vaccination rates.  
Similar resurgences have occurred in Europe and Asia, often linked to vaccine hesitancy or disrupted health services.

## Risks and Benefits
- **Benefits:** Prevents a disease that kills 1–3 per 1,000 cases in high-income settings and many more in low-resource areas.  
- **Risks:** Minor local or fever reactions; serious events are exceedingly rare and outweighed by benefits.

## FAQ
**Q: Is measles just a childhood rash?**  
A: No. It can cause life-threatening pneumonia or brain inflammation.  

**Q: Can adults get measles?**  
A: Yes. Anyone without immunity remains at risk.  

**Q: How many doses are needed for lifelong protection?**  
A: Two doses are sufficient for most people.  

**Q: Why do outbreaks still occur?**  
A: Because measles is so contagious that even small drops in coverage reopen transmission chains.
