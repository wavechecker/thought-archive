# Measles (Rubeola)

## Intro
**Measles** is a highly contagious viral illness that spreads through the air and can remain infectious for up to **two hours** after an infected person leaves a room.

Although preventable by vaccination, measles outbreaks are resurging worldwide due to **immunity gaps**, disrupted healthcare systems, and declining vaccination coverage.

<Aside title="Critical Threshold" variant="warning">
To prevent sustained transmission, **at least 95% of the population must receive two MMR doses**.  
Even small drops below this level can trigger outbreaks.
</Aside>

## Key Points
- One of the **most contagious viruses** known  
- Airborne transmission with prolonged environmental survival  
- Serious complications including pneumonia and encephalitis  
- No antiviral cure — prevention is essential  
- Two-dose MMR vaccination provides ~97% protection  

## Risk Stratification

    { label: "Immunocompromised individuals", level: "high" },
    { label: "Fully vaccinated adults", level: "low" }
  ]}
/>

## The Disease
- **Transmission:** Airborne droplets and aerosols  
- **Incubation period:** 7–14 days  
- **Early symptoms:** Fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes  
- **Classic signs:** Koplik spots followed by a spreading red rash  
- **Immune effects:** Temporary immune suppression lasting months  

## Complications
- Pneumonia (most common cause of death)  
- Encephalitis (~1 in 1,000 cases)  
- Vision and hearing loss  
- **Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE)** — rare, delayed, and fatal  

## The Vaccine (MMR)
- **Licensed:** 1963  
- **Effectiveness:** ~93% after one dose, ~97% after two doses  
- **Safety:** Excellent; serious adverse events are extremely rare  
- **Population benefit:** Protects infants and vulnerable individuals via herd immunity  

<Aside title="MMRV Policy Update" variant="info">
Some advisory bodies recommend **separate MMR and varicella vaccines** for children under 4 years due to a slightly higher risk of febrile seizures with MMRV.  
MMRV remains approved and widely used.
</Aside>

## Why Outbreaks Are Returning
- Missed routine childhood vaccinations during COVID-19  
- Conflict and population displacement  
- Health system strain  
- Vaccine misinformation and hesitancy  
- International travel seeding new clusters  

## FAQ
**Q: Can vaccinated people still get measles?**  
A: Rarely. Breakthrough cases are usually mild and much less contagious.

**Q: Is measles only a childhood illness?**  
A: No. Adults can become severely ill, especially if unvaccinated.

**Q: Is vitamin A useful in measles?**  
A: Yes. In children, vitamin A supplementation reduces severity and mortality.
