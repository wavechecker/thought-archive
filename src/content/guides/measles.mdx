# Measles (Rubeola): The Disease and the Vaccine

## Intro
**Measles** is one of the most contagious viruses known — capable of infecting up to 9 out of 10 unvaccinated contacts after exposure.  
It spreads through the air and can remain suspended for up to two hours.  

The **measles vaccine** (MMR: measles, mumps, rubella) is safe, highly effective, and essential to public health.  
Outbreaks return wherever coverage drops.

<Aside title="Important" variant="warning">
To stop measles transmission, **at least 95%** of the population must have two documented doses of MMR.  
Coverage below that threshold enables outbreaks.
</Aside>

## Key Points
- **Contagious:** One case can infect most unvaccinated contacts nearby.  
- **Vaccine effectiveness:** ~97% after two doses.  
- **Herd protection:** ~95% coverage required.  
- **Impact:** Over 23 million deaths prevented since 2000.  
- **Safety:** Decades of data show no link to autism.

## The Disease
- **Transmission:** Airborne droplets/aerosols; survives up to 2 hours.  
- **Symptoms:** Fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, **Koplik spots**, spreading rash.  
- **Complications:** Pneumonia, encephalitis (~1 in 1,000), rare fatal SSPE.  
- **At risk:** Infants, pregnant people, immunocompromised.

## The Vaccine
- **History:** Licensed 1963; improved formulations soon after.  
- **Formulations:** MMR or MMRV.  
- **Effectiveness:** One dose ≈ 93%; two ≈ 97%.  
- **Safety:** Mild reactions common; serious events exceedingly rare.  
- **Myths:** Autism claim was fraudulent and retracted.

<Aside title="Note on MMRV Policy" variant="info">
As of **September 2025**, U.S. advisors recommend **separate MMR + varicella** shots for children < 4 years due to slightly higher seizure risk with MMRV.  
MMRV remains covered under **Vaccines for Children**.
</Aside>

## Recent Outbreaks
The **2025 U.S. outbreak** has surpassed 1,500 cases across > 20 states — the highest since 2019.  
Clusters arise where vaccination rates fell below 95%.  
International travel continues to seed cases.

## FAQ
**Q: Is measles just a childhood rash?**  
A: No — it can cause life-threatening complications.  

**Q: Can adults get measles?**  
A: Yes — unvaccinated adults remain vulnerable.  

**Q: How many doses for protection?**  
A: Two doses usually suffice for life.  

**Q: Why outbreaks now?**  
A: Coverage slipped below herd-immunity threshold.
