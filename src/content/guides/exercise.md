# Exercise and Mental Health

*[← Back to Toolkit](/guides/mental-health-toolkit)*

Exercise is one of the most effective non-drug treatments for depression and anxiety.  

---

## The Benefits

- **Immediate:** boosts mood, reduces stress hormones, increases endorphins  
- **Long-term:** lowers relapse risk for depression and anxiety  
- **Social:** team sports or group classes add connection and accountability  

---

## How Much is Enough?

- Even **20–30 minutes of brisk walking** can help  
- Aim for **150 minutes of moderate activity weekly**  
- Mix cardio (walking, cycling, swimming) with strength training and flexibility  

---

## Evidence Snapshot

- Meta-analyses show exercise can be **as effective as medication** for mild to moderate depression  
- Unlike drugs, the benefits persist if exercise becomes a routine habit  

Exercise is not a cure-all, but it is a powerful lever — often called a “natural antidepressant.”
