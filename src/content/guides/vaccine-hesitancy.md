# Vaccine Hesitancy

## Intro
Vaccine hesitancy refers to delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite availability of vaccination services. It is influenced by factors such as confidence, complacency, and convenience. The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified vaccine hesitancy as one of the top ten global health threats.

## Key Points
- **Definition:** Hesitancy ranges from delaying some vaccines to outright refusal, even when vaccines are available.  
- **Impact:** Declining uptake can lead to outbreaks of preventable diseases such as measles or pertussis.  
- **Causes:** Misinformation, safety concerns, religious or cultural beliefs, low trust in institutions, or complacency.  
- **Solutions:** Transparent communication, community engagement, and easy access to vaccination.  

## Background
Historically, resistance to vaccination dates back to the smallpox vaccine in the 19th century. Modern hesitancy has been fueled by misinformation — most notably the now-discredited claim linking the MMR vaccine to autism in the late 1990s. More recently, COVID-19 vaccine rollouts have been accompanied by politicization and social media amplification of fears.

## Causes
- **Confidence:** Distrust of health authorities, governments, or pharmaceutical companies.  
- **Complacency:** Belief that vaccine-preventable diseases are no longer a threat.  
- **Convenience:** Barriers such as cost, access, or logistics.  
- **Misinformation:** Spread of false claims online and through social networks.  
- **Cultural/Religious beliefs:** Some communities refuse vaccines on moral or spiritual grounds.  

## Risks / Benefits
- **Risks:** Lower coverage reduces herd immunity, leading to outbreaks (e.g., measles resurgence in Europe and the US). Can also erode trust in public health more broadly.  
- **Benefits of addressing it:** Targeted communication and outreach can improve uptake, protect vulnerable populations, and stabilize public confidence.  

## Global Context
- **WHO/SAGE:** Defines hesitancy as complex, context-specific, and varying across time and place.  
- **High-income countries:** Hesitancy often stems from misinformation and distrust.  
- **Low- and middle-income countries:** Barriers often include logistics, supply, or cultural beliefs.  
- **Australia (ATAGI):** Actively tracks uptake and develops strategies to address confidence issues.  

## FAQ
**Q: Is vaccine hesitancy the same as anti-vaccine activism?**  
A: No. Hesitancy includes delay, selective acceptance, or uncertainty — not just outright refusal.  

**Q: How can hesitancy be reduced?**  
A: Trusted messengers, clear evidence-based communication, addressing concerns respectfully, and improving access.  

**Q: Does hesitancy always lead to refusal?**  
A: No. Many hesitant individuals eventually vaccinate once their concerns are addressed.
