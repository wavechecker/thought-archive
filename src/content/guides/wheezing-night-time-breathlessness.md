## Intro
Wheezing and breathlessness at night are common but concerning symptoms. They may be caused by asthma, sleep apnoea, heart problems, or other conditions. Understanding the differences can help you decide when to seek medical advice.

## Key Points
- Night-time wheezing is often a sign of **asthma**.  
- Loud snoring, pauses in breathing, and unrefreshing sleep suggest **sleep apnoea**.  
- Heart failure and reflux can also cause night-time breathlessness.  
- Sudden or severe symptoms are always a red flag.  

## Causes
- **Asthma:** Airway inflammation narrows breathing passages, often worse at night.  
- **Sleep apnoea:** Collapsing airway during sleep leads to pauses in breathing.  
- **Heart failure:** Fluid build-up in the lungs may cause shortness of breath when lying down.  
- **Reflux (GERD):** Acid irritation can trigger cough and wheeze at night.  
- **Other:** Obesity, allergies, anxiety.  

## How to Tell the Difference
- **Asthma:** Wheeze + cough, often improves with inhaler.  
- **Sleep apnoea:** Loud snoring, daytime sleepiness, witnessed apnoeas.  
- **Heart failure:** Breathlessness lying flat, swelling of legs, fatigue.  

## What to Do
- Keep a **symptom diary**: when, how often, what triggers.  
- See your doctor for lung function tests or a sleep study.  
- **Emergency help:** sudden, severe breathlessness; chest pain; fainting; or blue lips.  

## FAQ
**Q: Is wheezing at night always asthma?**  
A: No. While asthma is common, other conditions like sleep apnoea or heart failure can cause it too.  

**Q: How can I tell if it's asthma or sleep apnoea?**  
A: Asthma often improves with inhalers, while sleep apnoea is linked to loud snoring and daytime tiredness.  

**Q: When should I seek urgent help?**  
A: Any sudden, severe, or unexplained breathlessness at night warrants emergency care.
