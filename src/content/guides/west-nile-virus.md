## Overview
West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that cycles mainly between **birds and mosquitoes**. Humans and horses are **dead-end hosts** — we can become ill, but we typically do not transmit the virus onward. Most infections cause **no symptoms**; some cause a **flu-like illness**; a small proportion develop **neuroinvasive disease**.

## How it spreads
- **Vectors:** Primarily *Culex* mosquitoes.
- **Reservoirs:** Wild birds maintain the virus in nature.
- **Seasonality:** Risk peaks in **late summer and early autumn**.
- **Ecology:** Warm, wet conditions (and sometimes drought clustering) amplify transmission.

## Recognize symptoms
- **Most people:** No symptoms.
- **Mild illness:** Fever, headache, body/joint aches, fatigue, rash.
- **Severe (neuroinvasive):** Severe headache, stiff neck, confusion, seizures, weakness or paralysis; may be life-threatening.

> **Seek urgent care** for any neurological symptoms or rapidly worsening illness.

## Prevention
- **Repellents:** DEET, picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus (follow label).
- **Clothing:** Long sleeves/pants; socks/shoes at dusk/dawn.
- **Home:** Install/repair window and door screens; use bed nets where appropriate.
- **Environment:** Remove standing water (gutters, pots, birdbaths); change pet water frequently; cover rain barrels.

## Treatment
- **No specific antiviral.**
- **Supportive care:** Rest, hydration, fever/pain control.
- **Severe disease:** Hospital-level care (IV fluids, monitoring, management of complications).

- **Dengue, Zika, Chikungunya:** Human-amplified mosquito viruses.
- **Japanese Encephalitis, Yellow Fever:** Wildlife reservoirs; vaccines exist (regional).
- **Ross River Virus (Australia & Pacific):** Wildlife reservoirs; joint pain prominent.
