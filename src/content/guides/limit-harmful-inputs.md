# Limiting Harmful Inputs

*[← Back to Toolkit](/guides/mental-health-toolkit)*

Sometimes protecting mental health means **cutting back** rather than adding more. Alcohol, smoking, and screen overuse all harm mental well-being.  

---

## Alcohol

- Acts as a **depressant**, worsening mood long-term  
- Increases risk of dependence and sleep disruption  
- Safer limit: ≤1 drink/day for women, ≤2 for men  

---

## Smoking

- Nicotine dependence harms both body and mind  
- Linked to higher rates of depression and anxiety  
- Quitting improves mental health as well as physical health  

➡️ See our detailed guide: [Smoking and Tobacco Cessation](/guides/smoking-cessation)  

---

## Screen Time

- Sedentary screen habits worsen mood and sleep  
- Social media overuse is tied to loneliness and anxiety  
- Set limits: turn off notifications, schedule offline days  

---

## Key Point

Reducing harmful inputs creates **space for healthier habits** to take root — improving both mental and physical resilience.
