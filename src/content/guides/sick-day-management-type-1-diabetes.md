# Sick‑Day Management for Type 1 Diabetes

## Core rules
- **Never stop basal insulin.**
- **Check BGL more often** (every 2–4 hours or as advised).
- **Check ketones** if BGL is high or you're unwell.

## Fluids & carbs
- Small, frequent sips of unsweetened fluids for hydration.
- If not eating normally, use **sick‑day carb options** to avoid ketosis.

## Insulin adjustments
- Use your written plan for **corrections** and **temporary basal** (if on pump).
- If persistent highs or ketones → contact your team early.

## Red flags (seek urgent care)
- **Ketones ≥ 3.0 mmol/L**, rising ketones, vomiting, abdominal pain, drowsiness, or rapid breathing.
