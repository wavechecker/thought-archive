# How Vaccines Work

## Intro
Vaccines train the immune system to recognise and fight infectious agents without causing the full disease. They are one of the most effective public health interventions, preventing millions of deaths each year. Understanding how they work requires a look at the immune system and the different types of vaccines used today.

## Key Points
- **Immunity basics:** Vaccines mimic infection to build protective memory without serious illness.  
- **Innate vs adaptive:** The innate system responds first; vaccines build adaptive memory (B cells, T cells).  
- **Types of vaccines:** Live attenuated, inactivated, subunit, conjugate, mRNA, and vector-based.  
- **Adjuvants:** Ingredients like aluminum salts boost response in some vaccines.  
- **Herd immunity:** When enough people are immune, diseases struggle to spread.  

## Background: The Immune System
- **Innate immunity:** The body’s immediate, non-specific defense (skin, mucosa, macrophages, interferons).  
- **Adaptive immunity:** A targeted response involving B cells (antibodies) and T cells (killer and helper cells).  
- **Immunological memory:** After infection or vaccination, memory B and T cells persist, allowing rapid and strong responses to future exposure.  

## How Vaccines Train Immunity
1. **Antigen introduction:** A harmless part of the pathogen (protein, sugar, RNA instructions) is introduced.  
2. **Immune recognition:** Antigen-presenting cells process the antigen and show it to T cells.  
3. **Activation:** B cells produce antibodies; T cells coordinate and destroy infected cells.  
4. **Memory formation:** After clearance, memory cells remain ready to respond.  

## Types of Vaccines
- **Live attenuated:** Weakened form of the virus/bacterium (e.g., measles, yellow fever). Strong, durable immunity but not for immunocompromised.  
- **Inactivated:** Killed pathogens (e.g., polio [IPV], hepatitis A). Safer, but may need boosters.  
- **Subunit/conjugate:** Specific proteins or sugars (e.g., HPV, Hib). Require adjuvants.  
- **mRNA vaccines:** Provide genetic instructions for antigen production (e.g., COVID-19). Rapid design, strong immunity.  
- **Viral vector:** Harmless carrier virus delivers genetic instructions (e.g., adenoviral COVID vaccines, Ebola).  

## Role of Adjuvants
- Some vaccines need a boost: adjuvants like aluminum salts (alum), MF59, or AS04 enhance immune response.  
- Adjuvants stimulate innate sensors, prolong antigen exposure, and improve adaptive immunity.  

## Herd Immunity
- When a high proportion of the population is immune, transmission chains are disrupted.  
- Herd immunity thresholds vary: measles (~95%), polio (~80–85%), COVID-19 (variable, higher due to evolving variants).  
- Herd immunity protects vulnerable individuals who cannot be vaccinated (e.g., infants, immunocompromised).  

## Risks / Benefits
- **Benefits:** Vaccines prevent disease, disability, and death, with benefits vastly outweighing risks.  
- **Risks:** Mild side effects (soreness, fever, fatigue) are common. Serious adverse events are very rare and closely monitored.  
- **Balance:** Risk of vaccine-preventable diseases is far greater than vaccine risks.  

## FAQ
**Q: Can vaccines give me the disease?**  
A: Live attenuated vaccines very rarely revert, but licensed products are safe. Inactivated, subunit, and mRNA vaccines cannot cause infection.  

**Q: How long does immunity last?**  
A: Depends on the vaccine. Some (measles, yellow fever) provide lifelong protection; others (influenza, pertussis) need boosters.  

**Q: Why are boosters needed?**  
A: To counter waning immunity or evolving pathogens.  

**Q: Do vaccines always prevent infection?**  
A: Not always. Some vaccines mainly prevent severe illness and transmission, even if mild infection occurs.
