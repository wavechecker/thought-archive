Mental health first aid is the help offered to someone experiencing a mental health problem, crisis, or emotional distress until professional support can be arranged.  
It focuses on **recognising warning signs, offering initial support, and guiding towards appropriate care** — much like physical first aid does for medical emergencies.

---

## Summary
- Recognise signs of distress early.  
- Approach with empathy and without judgment.  
- Offer reassurance and practical support.  
- Encourage professional help and self-care strategies.  
- Stay with the person if they are at risk of harm.  

---

## Key Principles
- **Approach without judgment** — create a safe, non-critical space.  
- **Listen actively** — focus fully, reflect back, and avoid interrupting.  
- **Give reassurance** — let them know they are not alone and help is available.  
- **Encourage professional help** — GP, psychologist, emergency services if needed.  
- **Promote self-help strategies** — breathing techniques, support groups, exercise, journaling, or relaxation.  

---

## Common Situations
- **Anxiety or panic attacks** — provide calm reassurance, slow breathing, remove stressors.  
- **Depression** — listen, encourage talking, avoid minimising their feelings.  
- **Suicidal thoughts or self-harm** — ask directly if they are thinking about suicide; this does not increase risk.  
- **Substance misuse** — express concern without blame, encourage safe withdrawal and professional support.  
- **Psychosis** (hearing voices, delusions, confusion) — remain calm, avoid confrontation, ensure safety until professional care arrives.  

---

## Crisis Actions
- **Ask directly about suicide** if warning signs are present. It is safe to ask:  
  - *“Are you thinking about suicide?”*  
  - *“Do you have a plan?”*  
  - *“Do you have the means to act on that plan?”*  
  Answers help gauge urgency and guide your next steps.  
- **Stay with them** — never leave someone alone if they may attempt suicide.  
- **Call emergency services (000 in Australia, 911/112 elsewhere)** if there is immediate danger.  
- **Provide helpline numbers or crisis text lines** (see below).  
- **Encourage follow-up care** — ensure they see a doctor or mental health professional as soon as possible.

## FAQs

**Q: Do I need special qualifications to provide mental health first aid?**  
A: No. Anyone can learn the basics, but completing a certified **Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) course** provides structured tools and confidence. MHFA training is available worldwide and was founded in Australia.  

**Q: Is mental health first aid the same as therapy?**  
A: No. It is immediate, short-term support until the person can access professional help. It does not replace ongoing treatment.  

**Q: Will asking about suicide put the idea in someone’s head?**  
A: No. Evidence shows that asking directly about suicidal thoughts can actually reduce risk, as it gives the person a chance to talk openly and feel supported.  

**Q: What if I say the wrong thing?**  
A: Showing compassion and a willingness to listen is more important than finding the “perfect” words. Avoid judgment, avoid minimising their feelings, and focus on being present.

⚠️ **Mental health crises can be life-threatening.**  
Always take suicidal thoughts or severe distress seriously. Stay with the person if they are at risk, call emergency services if needed, and encourage professional follow-up care.
