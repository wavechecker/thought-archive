# Asthma Action Plans for Adults and Children

## Overview
An asthma action plan is a personalized guide that helps people with asthma know how to manage their condition daily and what steps to take if symptoms get worse. It’s a simple but powerful tool for preventing severe attacks and reducing emergency visits.

## Key Points
- Written plan made with your healthcare provider.
- Divides asthma management into **green, yellow, and red zones** based on symptoms and peak flow readings.
- Helps patients, families, and schools act quickly when symptoms worsen.
- Recommended for both adults and children with asthma.

## Why an Asthma Action Plan is Important
Asthma can worsen suddenly, even when you feel well. A written plan:
- Provides clear daily instructions.
- Tells you what medication to take and when.
- Gives guidance on when to seek emergency help.
- Improves confidence and reduces anxiety for patients and caregivers.

## The Three Zones of an Asthma Action Plan

### Green Zone — Well Controlled
- No symptoms.
- Peak flow is 80–100% of your personal best.
- Continue daily controller medication as prescribed.

### Yellow Zone — Caution
- Symptoms like coughing, wheezing, or shortness of breath.
- Peak flow is 50–79% of personal best.
- Add quick-relief inhaler and follow your plan for additional medication.

### Red Zone — Emergency
- Severe symptoms, difficulty speaking, or blue lips.
- Peak flow below 50% of personal best.
- Use rescue medication immediately and seek emergency care.

## Special Considerations for Children
- Share the plan with teachers, school nurses, and caregivers.
- Use age-appropriate language and visual charts.
- Include steps for using a spacer or nebulizer.

## How to Get an Asthma Action Plan
- Work with your doctor or asthma nurse.
- Update at least once a year or after a severe attack.
- Carry a copy at all times.
