## Intro
Diabetes is a growing concern among children and adolescents worldwide. While type 1 diabetes has long been the most common form in childhood, a 2025 global study across 204 countries found that **cases of diabetes in children and teens nearly doubled between 1990 and 2021**, with the steepest growth in **type 2 diabetes**. Early diagnosis and management are essential because diabetes that begins in youth carries decades of cumulative risk.

## Key Points
- Diabetes in children and teens has nearly **doubled worldwide since 1990**.  
- **Type 1 diabetes**: Autoimmune, usually diagnosed in childhood, lifelong insulin required.  
- **Type 2 diabetes**: Strongly linked to obesity, poor diet, and inactivity; fastest-rising form in youth.  
- Classic symptoms: frequent urination, thirst, fatigue, blurred vision, weight changes.  
- Management combines medical treatment, healthy eating, activity, and education.  
- Prevention strategies focus on obesity reduction, nutrition, and active lifestyles.  
- Good care lowers early mortality, but long-term complications remain a concern.  

## Background
Diabetes disrupts how the body regulates blood sugar (glucose):  
- **Type 1 diabetes**: Autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic cells. Not preventable.  
- **Type 2 diabetes**: Insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion. Previously rare in children but now increasing rapidly with obesity and sedentary lifestyles.  

Both types can cause serious complications if not managed early and consistently.

## Global Trends
Hu et al. (2025) analyzed diabetes burden in children and adolescents across **204 countries from 1990 to 2021**.  
- Global prevalence in youth nearly doubled in three decades.  
- Type 2 diabetes accounted for the largest proportional increase.  
- Improved care has reduced early mortality, but long-term risk remains high.  
- Regional disparities exist, with rising rates in both high- and low-income countries.  

## Causes or Mechanisms
- **Type 1**: Autoimmune, genetic predisposition, environmental triggers (not preventable).  
- **Type 2**:  
  - Obesity and excess weight → insulin resistance.  
  - Diets high in sugar and ultra-processed foods.  
  - Sedentary lifestyles and increased screen time.  
  - Social determinants: food environments, socioeconomic factors, and access to healthcare.  

## Symptoms
- Excessive thirst (polydipsia)  
- Frequent urination (polyuria)  
- Unexplained weight loss or gain  
- Fatigue and irritability  
- Blurred vision  
- In severe cases: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or diabetic ketoacidosis (more common in type 1).  

## Diagnosis / Treatment / Options
- **Diagnosis**: Fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, oral glucose tolerance test. Autoantibody tests help distinguish type 1 from type 2.  
- **Treatment**:  
  - *Type 1*: Lifelong insulin therapy (injections or pump), continuous glucose monitoring, dietary planning.  
  - *Type 2*: Lifestyle interventions (nutrition, exercise, sleep), weight management, oral medications (metformin), sometimes insulin.  
- **Support**: Diabetes education, psychological support, family involvement, and school-based care plans.  

## Risks / Prognosis
Without control, chronic high blood sugar damages:  
- **Heart and blood vessels** → early cardiovascular disease.  
- **Kidneys** → diabetic nephropathy.  
- **Eyes** → retinopathy and vision loss.  
- **Nerves** → neuropathy.  

Early-onset diabetes increases lifetime risk of complications, but good glycemic control, healthy weight, and sustained lifestyle changes greatly improve prognosis.

## FAQ
**Q: What’s the difference between type 1 and type 2 diabetes in children?**  
A: Type 1 is autoimmune and not preventable. Type 2 is lifestyle-linked and largely preventable.  

**Q: Which type is rising fastest in children and teens?**  
A: Type 2 diabetes, strongly linked to obesity and poor diet.  

**Q: Can children outgrow diabetes?**  
A: No. Type 1 is lifelong; type 2 requires long-term management, though control can improve with lifestyle changes.  

**Q: Has care improved?**  
A: Yes — better diagnostics, therapies, and education have reduced early mortality, but long-term risks remain high.
