faq:
  - q: "Who should consider nicotinamide?"
    a: "People with a history of nonmelanoma skin cancer (basal cell carcinoma or cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma), especially after their first tumor. Discuss with your clinician."
  - q: "What dose was studied?"
    a: "500 mg by mouth twice daily for more than 30 days, as documented in VA electronic health records."
  - q: "Does it help everyone?"
    a: "Benefits were strongest after a first skin cancer and were less clear in solid organ transplant recipients."
  - q: "Is nicotinamide the same as niacin?"
    a: "No. Nicotinamide (niacinamide) is a form of vitamin B3 that does not cause flushing. Do not substitute high-dose niacin."
  - q: "Does it replace sunscreen and skin checks?"
    a: "No. It's an adjunct to sun protection, regular dermatology follow-up, and early treatment."

## Intro
Nicotinamide — a form of vitamin B3 (niacinamide) — has been studied as a way to prevent nonmelanoma skin cancers. A new *JAMA Dermatology* study of 33,822 U.S. veterans suggests it can lower the risk of basal cell carcinoma and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, especially when started soon after a first skin cancer.

## Key Points
- Nicotinamide 500 mg twice daily was linked to a **14% overall reduction** in skin cancer risk.  
- Starting nicotinamide after a **first skin cancer** → risk reduction of **54%**.  
- Greatest effect seen in **cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC)**.  
- No significant overall benefit in solid organ transplant recipients (some signal for early use in cSCC).  
- Builds on ONTRAC (NEJM 2015) with large, real-world validation.

## Background
Nonmelanoma skin cancers — basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and cSCC — are the most common cancers in fair-skinned populations. Preventing recurrences is a major clinical need. Earlier trials suggested nicotinamide could help; this new retrospective cohort leveraged VA data (1999–2024) to evaluate outcomes at scale.

## Causes or Mechanisms
Nicotinamide is thought to:
- **Boost DNA repair** after UV damage  
- **Reduce inflammation** that fosters carcinogenesis  
- **Support skin immune responses**

## Diagnosis / Treatment / Options
- **Dose studied:** 500 mg orally, twice daily, >30 days.  
- **Use case:** Secondary prevention after a first nonmelanoma skin cancer; discuss duration and monitoring with your clinician.  
- **Not a substitute for:** Sunscreen, protective clothing, shade, or routine dermatology checks.  
- **Special populations:** Transplant recipients/immunosuppressed may see less benefit; individualized care is essential.

## Risks / Benefits / Prognosis
- **Benefits:** Inexpensive, widely available, generally well-tolerated; meaningful risk reduction, strongest with early initiation.  
- **Risks:** Nicotinamide typically lacks the flushing seen with niacin; still discuss interactions and kidney/liver history with a clinician.  
- **Prognosis:** Early adoption after the first cancer is associated with the largest risk reduction.

## FAQ
**Q: Who should consider nicotinamide?**  
A: People with prior BCC or cSCC, especially after their first tumor.  

**Q: Is nicotinamide the same as niacin?**  
A: No. Nicotinamide (niacinamide) does not cause flushing; do not substitute high-dose niacin.  

**Q: Does it prevent melanoma?**  
A: Evidence is limited; current signal is for BCC and cSCC.  

**Q: How long should I take it?**  
A: Duration isn’t standardized; clinicians often reassess at 12 months alongside skin exam frequency and recurrence history.  

**Q: Any side effects?**  
A: Generally mild; discuss with your clinician if you have kidney/liver disease or are on interacting meds.
