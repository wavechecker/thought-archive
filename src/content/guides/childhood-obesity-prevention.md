## Intro
In 2025, childhood obesity overtook underweight worldwide for the first time. This marked a global tipping point in nutrition: the challenge is no longer just too little food, but too much of the wrong food. Preventing obesity in children is now one of the most urgent public health priorities.

## Key Points
- Childhood obesity now surpasses underweight globally.  
- Environments filled with ultra-processed foods and sugary drinks drive this trend.  
- Risks include diabetes, heart disease, and reduced life expectancy.  
- Parents, schools, and policymakers all play roles in prevention.  
- Proven strategies: healthier school meals, marketing restrictions, sugar taxes, affordable produce, and youth engagement.  

## Background
Malnutrition today has two forms: undernutrition and overnutrition. While some children still face stunting and wasting, more are now living with obesity. This double burden is particularly stark in low- and middle-income countries where cheap processed foods have flooded markets and healthy options remain costly or scarce.

## Causes or Mechanisms
- **Unhealthy food environments**: Processed snacks and sugary drinks are widely available and inexpensive.  
- **Marketing**: Children are directly targeted through advertising and online platforms.  
- **Economic barriers**: Nutritious foods are often more costly than high-calorie processed alternatives.  
- **Lifestyle**: Sedentary behaviors, screen time, and reduced outdoor play.  
- **Policy gaps**: Weak or absent regulations on school food, advertising, and labeling.  

## Diagnosis / Treatment / Options
- **Diagnosis**: BMI-for-age percentile or WHO/CDC growth standards.  
- **Management**: Nutrition counseling, more physical activity, limiting screen time, and family-based support.  
- **System-level solutions**: Comprehensive public health measures — not just lifestyle advice — are needed to reverse the trend (e.g., marketing restrictions, sugar-sweetened beverage taxes, clear front-of-pack labels, strong school food standards).  

## Risks / Prognosis
- **Health risks**: Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, fatty liver disease, orthopedic problems, and psychological effects such as bullying and low self-esteem.  
- **Prognosis**: Early prevention and supportive environments can help children return to healthier growth trajectories. Without intervention, obesity often persists into adulthood, raising lifelong risks.  

## FAQ
**Q: Why is childhood obesity rising so quickly?**  
A: Because ultra-processed foods are cheap, aggressively marketed, and widely available, while healthier options are harder to access.

**Q: Is it only a problem in rich countries?**  
A: No. The fastest increases are in low- and middle-income countries.

**Q: Can families manage this on their own?**  
A: Families are important, but systemic changes — in schools, food policy, and marketing — are essential.

**Q: What prevention strategies work?**  
A: Sugar taxes, restrictions on junk food advertising, healthy school food policies, clear labeling, breastfeeding support, and better access to fresh, affordable produce.
