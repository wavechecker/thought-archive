## Intro
Diabetes is a growing health concern among children and adolescents worldwide. While type 1 diabetes remains the most common form in childhood, type 2 diabetes is increasing rapidly, linked to rising obesity and sedentary lifestyles. Understanding both types is essential for early recognition and management.

## Key Points
- **Type 1 diabetes**: Autoimmune condition, usually diagnosed in childhood, requiring lifelong insulin therapy.  
- **Type 2 diabetes**: Previously rare in children, now increasing due to obesity and poor diet.  
- Symptoms include frequent urination, thirst, fatigue, and unexplained weight changes.  
- Management combines medical treatment, healthy eating, and physical activity.  
- Prevention strategies target obesity, nutrition, and active lifestyles.  

## Background
Diabetes disrupts how the body regulates blood sugar (glucose). In type 1, the immune system attacks insulin-producing cells. In type 2, the body becomes resistant to insulin, often linked to excess weight and inactivity. Both forms can cause long-term complications if unmanaged.

## Causes or Mechanisms
- **Type 1**: Autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells; not preventable.  
- **Type 2**: Insulin resistance due to obesity, poor diet, and sedentary lifestyle; preventable in many cases.  

## Diagnosis / Treatment / Options
- **Diagnosis**: Blood glucose testing (fasting glucose, HbA1c, or oral glucose tolerance test).  
- **Treatment**:  
  - *Type 1*: Insulin therapy (multiple daily injections or pump), blood glucose monitoring/CGM, and dietary planning.  
  - *Type 2*: Lifestyle changes (nutrition, exercise), weight management, and sometimes oral medication or insulin.  
- **Support**: Diabetes education, psychological support, and school-based accommodations (care plans for teachers and staff).  

## Risks / Prognosis
- Without control, high blood sugar can damage the heart, kidneys, eyes, and nerves.  
- Early diagnosis and proper management allow children to live healthy, full lives.  
- Prognosis is best with strong family, school, and healthcare support.

## FAQ
**Q: Whatâ€™s the difference between type 1 and type 2 diabetes in children?**  
A: Type 1 is autoimmune and not preventable. Type 2 is linked to obesity and lifestyle, and is preventable in many cases.

**Q: Can children outgrow diabetes?**  
A: No. Type 1 diabetes is lifelong; type 2 can improve with lifestyle changes and treatment but requires ongoing management.

**Q: Are symptoms different in children?**  
A: Classic symptoms are similar: thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, blurred vision, and weight changes. Seek medical advice promptly if suspected.
