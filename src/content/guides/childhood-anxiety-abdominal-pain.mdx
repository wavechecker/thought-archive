# When Anxiety Causes Abdominal Pain in Children

## Intro

Abdominal pain linked to anxiety — often called **functional abdominal pain** — is one of the most common causes of recurrent pain in children.

It can be intense, frightening, and disruptive.  
And crucially:

> **The pain is real, even when tests are normal.**

Understanding the *pattern* of anxiety-related pain helps families support children confidently without missing serious illness.

---

## Why Anxiety Can Cause Real Pain

The gut and brain are tightly connected through the **gut–brain axis**.

In children:
- Stress increases gut sensitivity
- Normal bowel movements can feel painful
- Gut motility may speed up or slow down
- Pain signals are amplified

There is **no tissue damage**, but the pain experience is genuine.

---

## Typical Pattern of Anxiety-Related Abdominal Pain

Common features include:

- Pain around the **belly button**
- Recurrent episodes over weeks or months
- Pain before:
  - school
  - exams
  - social events
  - separation from caregivers
- Improvement on weekends or holidays
- Normal appetite and energy between episodes
- Normal physical exams and tests

---

## Behavioural Clues That Reassure

Often more useful than pain descriptions:

| Observation | Suggests |
|------------|---------|
| Distractible pain | Functional |
| Plays when engaged | Low risk |
| Pain settles with reassurance | Functional |
| Normal growth | Reassuring |
| Stable pattern | Functional |

---

## What Anxiety Pain Is *Not*

Anxiety-related pain usually **does not**:

- Progressively worsen over hours
- Localise to one spot
- Wake a child from sleep
- Cause persistent vomiting
- Stop a child from walking or moving
- Cause weight loss or poor growth

If these occur, reassessment is needed.

---

## Supporting a Child Safely

Key principles:

- Validate the pain — don’t dismiss it
- Avoid excessive testing once serious causes are excluded
- Maintain routines and school attendance when safe
- Avoid reinforcing avoidance or sick-role behaviours
- Address underlying stressors gradually

Psychological strategies (e.g. CBT) can be very effective when needed.

---

## When to Re-evaluate

Seek medical review if:

- Pain pattern changes
- Pain worsens or localises
- Pain wakes the child from sleep
- Vomiting, fever, or blood in stool appears
- Appetite or growth declines
- Movement becomes painful

---

## Anxiety vs Appendicitis vs Constipation (quick contrast)

| Feature | Anxiety-related | Appendicitis | Constipation |
|------|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| Time course | Recurrent, stable | Progressive | Chronic/recurrent |
| Localisation | Central | Often right-sided | Diffuse/lower |
| Movement pain | No | Yes | Usually mild |
| Appetite | Usually normal | Drops off | Variable |
| Response to reassurance | Improves | No | Sometimes |

## FAQ

**Q: Can anxiety really cause severe pain?**  
A: Yes. The pain experience is real, even without disease.

**Q: Will this cause long-term damage?**  
A: No. Functional abdominal pain does not damage organs.

**Q: Should school be avoided?**  
A: Usually no. Maintaining routines helps recovery unless red flags are present.
