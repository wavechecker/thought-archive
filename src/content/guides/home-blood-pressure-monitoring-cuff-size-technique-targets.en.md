# Home Blood Pressure Monitoring — Cuff Size, Technique, Targets

Home Blood Pressure Monitoring — Cuff Size, Technique, Targets
Overview

Home monitoring is one of the best ways to keep track of your heart health. Done correctly, it gives more accurate readings than the occasional clinic check.

Key Symptoms

(Not symptoms — but reasons to monitor.)

Diagnosed hypertension

Family history of high blood pressure

Adjusting medications

Monitoring lifestyle changes

Causes / Risk Factors

Using the wrong cuff size (too small = falsely high)

Poor positioning (arm not at heart level)

Talking or moving during the test

Measuring right after coffee or exercise

What To Do Now

Sit quietly for 5 minutes before measuring

Place cuff on bare upper arm, correct size

Keep feet flat, back supported, arm at heart level

Take two readings a minute apart; average them

Diagnosis & Treatment

Doctors use both clinic and home readings to confirm diagnosis and adjust medication. Consistent readings above 135/85 at home are usually considered high.

Prevention / Daily Management

Measure at the same time each day

Keep a log of results (paper or app)

Bring your device to clinic visits to check accuracy

Red-Flag Signs (Seek Urgent Care)

BP consistently >180/110 mmHg

Sudden chest pain, breathlessness, or neurological symptoms
