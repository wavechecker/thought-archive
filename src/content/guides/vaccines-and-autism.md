# Vaccines and Autism


## Intro
Define the claim; why it matters; brief on scientific consensus.


## Key Points
- Multiple large, well‑designed studies do not support a link.
- Ecological/correlation analyses have known flaws.
- Surveillance continues; extremely rare effects can’t be fully excluded.


## Background
Origins of the controversy; timeline of key publications and retractions.


## Evidence
Large cohort studies; mechanistic data; meta‑analyses.


## Risks / Benefits
Public‑health impact of declining vaccination vs. speculative risks.


## FAQ
**Q: What about aluminum adjuvants?**
A: See related guide; current evidence does not support harm at vaccine doses.
