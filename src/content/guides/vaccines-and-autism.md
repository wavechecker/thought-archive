# Vaccines and Autism

## Intro
Claims that vaccines cause autism have circulated since the late 1990s, fueled by a now-retracted paper in *The Lancet*. Despite repeated scientific investigations, no credible evidence has been found linking any vaccine ingredient or schedule to autism. The controversy persists, however, and has contributed to vaccine hesitancy and outbreaks of preventable diseases.

## Key Points
- **No causal link:** Multiple large studies involving millions of children show no association between vaccines (including MMR and aluminum adjuvants) and autism.  
- **Origins:** The controversy began with a 1998 paper alleging a link between MMR and autism, later found fraudulent and retracted.  
- **Flawed studies:** Ecological and correlation-based analyses that suggested a link have been widely debunked.  
- **Ongoing monitoring:** Vaccine safety is continuously monitored worldwide; extremely rare risks cannot be entirely excluded, but autism is not among them.  
- **Public health cost:** Vaccine hesitancy, partly driven by this myth, has led to measles outbreaks and erosion of trust in health systems.  

## Background
- **1998:** Andrew Wakefield and colleagues published a study in *The Lancet* claiming MMR was linked to autism. The study was based on only 12 children, lacked proper controls, and used flawed methods.  
- **2004–2010:** Investigations revealed undisclosed conflicts of interest and data manipulation. *The Lancet* fully retracted the paper in 2010, and Wakefield was barred from practicing medicine in the UK.  
- **Aftermath:** Despite retraction, the claim gained traction in media and online, fueling skepticism that continues today.  

## Evidence
- **Large cohort studies:**  
  - Danish studies (2002, 2019, 2025) involving hundreds of thousands to over a million children found no increased risk of autism after MMR or aluminum-containing vaccines.  
  - US and UK population studies confirm the absence of association across ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographic groups.  
- **Meta-analyses:** Reviews pooling data from millions of children find no link between vaccines and autism spectrum disorder (ASD).  
- **Mechanistic studies:** No plausible biological mechanism has been identified by which MMR, aluminum adjuvants, or other vaccine ingredients could cause ASD.  
- **Surveillance systems:** Ongoing monitoring through VAERS (US), EudraVigilance (EU), and AusVaxSafety (Australia) shows no autism signal from vaccines.  

## Risks / Benefits
- **Risks of the myth:** Fear of autism has driven declines in vaccine uptake, leading to outbreaks of measles, mumps, and pertussis.  
- **Benefits of vaccines:** Prevent millions of deaths globally each year, with risks overwhelmingly outweighed by protection from serious disease.  
- **Balance:** The claim of a vaccine–autism link has been studied more exhaustively than almost any other vaccine question. The scientific consensus is clear: **vaccines do not cause autism**.  

## FAQ
**Q: Didn’t the MMR vaccine cause autism in Wakefield’s study?**  
A: The study was fraudulent, retracted, and discredited. Larger, high-quality studies show no such link.  

**Q: What about aluminum adjuvants?**  
A: See the related guide. Current evidence shows no harmful effect of aluminum at vaccine doses.  

**Q: Could it be a timing coincidence?**  
A: Yes. Autism symptoms often become noticeable around the same age vaccines are given, creating a false appearance of cause-and-effect.  

**Q: Why does this myth persist?**  
A: Emotional narratives, distrust of authorities, and the rapid spread of misinformation online.
