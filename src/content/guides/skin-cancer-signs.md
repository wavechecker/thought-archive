# Skin Cancer — Warning Signs

Australia has among the **highest melanoma rates in the world**.  
- Every **30 minutes, someone is diagnosed with melanoma**.  
- Every **six hours, someone dies from it**.  

That’s why recognising early warning signs and acting quickly is critical.  

**Summary**  
Check your skin regularly. Know the warning signs. Seek medical care early.  

## Types of Skin Cancer
- **Basal cell carcinoma** — slow-growing, rarely spreads  
- **Squamous cell carcinoma** — can spread if untreated  
- **Melanoma** — most dangerous, can spread rapidly  

## Warning Signs (ABCDE for moles)
- **A**symmetry — uneven halves  
- **B**order — irregular or jagged edges  
- **C**olour — multiple colours or uneven tone  
- **D**iameter — larger than 6mm  
- **E**volving — changes in size, shape, or colour  

Other warning signs:  
- New spots that look different from others (“ugly duckling” rule)  
- Sores that don’t heal  
- Red, scaly, or bleeding patches  

## FAQs
**Q: Do darker skin tones get skin cancer?**  
A: Yes. Risk is lower, but cancers may be diagnosed later and at a more dangerous stage.  

**Q: How often should I check my skin?**  
A: Monthly self-checks, plus a yearly professional skin exam.  

**Q: When should I see a doctor?**
