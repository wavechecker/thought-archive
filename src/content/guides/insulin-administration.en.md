# Insulin Administration — Pens, Syringes, and Pumps

## Why this matters
Insulin keeps you healthy and prevents DKA. Correct dosing and delivery technique make a big difference to day-to-day control.

## Pens and syringes (MDI)
- **Types:** long-acting (basal) + rapid-acting (bolus/corrections).  
- **Technique:** prime pens, check dose window, inject at 90° (or 45° if very lean), hold for 10 seconds before removing.  
- **Sites:** abdomen, thighs, buttocks, upper arms. **Rotate** to prevent lipohypertrophy.  
- **Timing:** rapid-acting usually **0–15 min before eating** (varies by insulin and meal).

## Pumps
- Provide **continuous basal** + **bolus** for meals/corrections.  
- **Change infusion set/site** as recommended (often every 2–3 days).  
- Watch for alarms and **site issues** (redness, pain, dislodgement, air bubbles).  
- If **ketones** or unexplained high BGL → **give correction by pen/syringe**, then **change set** (suspect delivery failure).

## Storage and safety
- Keep insulin **refrigerated** before first use; in-use pens/cartridges usually okay at **room temp** (check product info).  
- Avoid heat/freezing; **do not use** if cloudy (unless designed to be) or past expiry.  
- Carry **spare insulin**, pen needles, and **backup syringes** even if on a pump.

## Common mistakes to avoid
- Skipping **basal** insulin  
- Re-using pen needles/lancets repeatedly → infection, poor absorption  
- Injecting into **lipohypertrophy** → erratic absorption  
- Not adjusting timing/dose around **exercise**, illness, or large/high-fat meals

## When to seek help
- Recurrent **lows** or **highs** despite careful dosing  
- **Pump occlusions** or repeated site failures  
- Uncertainty about **dose adjustments** for sick days, travel, or sports
