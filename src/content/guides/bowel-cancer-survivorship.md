# Bowel Cancer Survivorship — Life After Treatment

Completing treatment for bowel cancer is a major milestone. Survivorship is about **life after treatment** — managing side effects, monitoring for recurrence, and building habits that support long-term health.  

---

## Follow-Up Care
- **Check-ups**: Regular visits with your oncologist or surgeon, especially in the first 2–5 years.  
- **Colonoscopy**: To look for new polyps or cancers.  
- **Blood tests (CEA marker)**: May help detect recurrence in some cases.  
- **Scans (CT, MRI, PET)**: Used if there are concerning symptoms or test results.  

> ⚠️ Most recurrences happen within the first five years — this is why follow-up is so important.  

---

## Managing Long-Term Side Effects
- **Bowel changes**: Diarrhoea, urgency, or constipation may continue for some.  
- **Nerve damage (neuropathy)**: Tingling in fingers or toes from chemotherapy can persist.  
- **Fatigue**: May last months or years but often improves gradually.  
- **Stoma care**: Some people adapt to a permanent stoma as part of long-term survivorship.  

---

## Lifestyle and Prevention
- **Diet**: High in fibre, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains; low in processed/red meat.  
- **Exercise**: Regular physical activity lowers risk of recurrence and boosts wellbeing.  
- **Weight management**: Maintaining a healthy weight supports bowel and overall health.  
- **Avoid smoking and excess alcohol**.  

---

## Emotional and Social Wellbeing
- Anxiety about recurrence is common — this is sometimes called "scanxiety."  
- Support groups, counselling, or mindfulness practices can help.  
- Survivorship includes rebuilding confidence in work, relationships, and everyday life.  

---

## Secondary Cancers and Other Risks
- People with inherited syndromes (e.g., Lynch syndrome) may have a higher risk of other cancers (uterine, ovarian, stomach).  
- Ongoing screening may be needed for these as well.  

---

## Takeaway
Survivorship isn't just about being "cancer-free." It's about adapting, monitoring, and thriving after treatment. With regular follow-up and healthy lifestyle changes, many people live long, fulfilling lives after bowel cancer.
