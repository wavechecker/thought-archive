## Intro

Appendicitis is one of the most common surgical emergencies in children — and one of the **easiest to miss early**.

The reason is simple:

> **Appendicitis rarely starts dramatically.**

Early symptoms can look like a mild stomach bug, constipation, or anxiety-related pain. Understanding the *pattern of progression* is far more important than any single symptom.

---

## What the Appendix Is (and Why It Hurts)

The appendix is a small pouch attached to the large intestine.

When it becomes blocked and inflamed:
- Pressure builds inside
- Blood supply becomes compromised
- Inflammation spreads to the surrounding lining

Pain increases as inflammation progresses — which is why **worsening pain over time** is a critical clue.

---

## The Typical Progression Pattern

Many children follow a similar sequence:

1. **Vague pain** around the belly button  
2. Pain that **worsens over hours**  
3. Pain that **moves to the right lower abdomen**  
4. **Loss of appetite** (often striking)  
5. Pain with movement (walking, jumping, coughing)  

Vomiting and fever often appear **later**, not at the start.

---

## Why Appendicitis Is Often Missed

Appendicitis is commonly missed early because:

- Pain starts mild and non-specific
- Children may struggle to describe location
- Early tests can be normal
- Symptoms overlap with:
  - viral illness
  - constipation
  - functional abdominal pain

The key difference is **progression**.

---

## Behavioural Clues That Matter

Often more telling than pain descriptions:

| Observation | Suggests |
|-----------|---------|
| Child lies very still | Concerning |
| Avoids walking/jumping | Concerning |
| Appetite suddenly gone | Concerning |
| Pain improving | Less likely appendicitis |
| Distractible pain | Less likely appendicitis |

---

## What Does *Not* Rule Out Appendicitis

- Mild pain at first  
- Normal blood tests early  
- Temporary symptom fluctuation  
- Young age (appendicitis occurs in toddlers)  

Clinical reassessment over time is often the diagnostic tool.

---

## When to Seek Urgent Care

Seek urgent medical assessment if a child has:

- Abdominal pain **worsening over 6–12 hours**
- Pain that **localises**, especially to the right lower abdomen
- Pain with walking, jumping, or coughing
- Persistent vomiting
- Fever with abdominal pain
- Sudden testicular or pelvic pain

## Appendicitis vs Other Common Causes (Quick Contrast)

| Feature | Appendicitis | Anxiety-related | Constipation |
|------|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| Time course | Progressive | Recurrent/stable | Chronic/recurrent |
| Localisation | Often right-sided | Central | Diffuse/lower |
| Appetite | Drops off | Usually normal | Variable |
| Movement pain | Yes | No | Usually mild |
| Response to reassurance | No | Yes | Sometimes |

## FAQ

**Q: Can appendicitis start with diarrhoea or vomiting?**  
A: Yes. Early appendicitis can mimic gastroenteritis, especially in younger children.

**Q: Can appendicitis resolve on its own?**  
A: Untreated appendicitis usually progresses and can lead to perforation.

**Q: Should painkillers be avoided?**  
A: Appropriate pain relief does not mask appendicitis and should not be withheld while seeking care.
