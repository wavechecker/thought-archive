# Nutrition Basics for Bowel Cancer — Eating Well During and After Treatment

Food choices play a major role in both **reducing risk** and **supporting recovery** from bowel cancer. While there’s no single “anti-cancer diet,” the right nutrition can help your body cope with treatment, maintain strength, and improve quality of life.

---

## General Principles
- Aim for a **balanced diet** with whole grains, fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats.  
- Limit **processed and red meats**, which are linked with higher bowel cancer risk.  
- Reduce **alcohol and sugary drinks**.  
- Prioritise **fibre** long-term, but adjust intake based on treatment stage and tolerance.  

---

## During Treatment
- **After surgery**: A temporary low-fibre (low-residue) diet may be advised to rest the bowel, before fibre is gradually reintroduced.  
- **Chemotherapy**: Soft, bland foods may be easier if you experience nausea or taste changes. Staying well-hydrated is key.  
- **Radiotherapy**: Some people need to avoid very high-fibre or gas-forming foods if bowel sensitivity increases.

## Foods That Support Recovery
- **High-protein foods**: Eggs, fish, poultry, legumes, and dairy support healing.  
- **Fibre-rich foods**: Whole grains, beans, vegetables, and fruit support bowel regularity once tolerated.  
- **Healthy fats**: Olive oil, avocado, nuts, and seeds provide energy and reduce inflammation.  
- **Probiotics**: Yoghurt and fermented foods may help restore gut bacteria, especially after antibiotics.  

---

## Practical Tips
- Eat **small, frequent meals** if your appetite is low.  
- Keep a **food and symptom diary** to identify foods that trigger discomfort.  
- Work with a **dietitian** for personalised guidance, especially if you have a stoma or ongoing digestive issues.

## Takeaway
Nutrition is not just about reducing cancer risk — it’s about supporting your body during treatment and recovery. Eating well helps maintain energy, strengthen the immune system, and improve overall wellbeing.
