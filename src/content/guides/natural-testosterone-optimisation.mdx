# Natural Testosterone Optimisation Guide for Men

Testosterone influences strength, energy, mood, libido and metabolic health.  
While levels decline slowly with age, modern lifestyle factors can push testosterone far lower than biology alone would predict.

This guide outlines **drug-free, evidence-based methods** to optimise testosterone.

---

## 1. Nutrition: Building Hormones From the Ground Up

Testosterone synthesis requires cholesterol and adequate micronutrients.  
Very low-fat or restrictive diets may suppress hormone production.

### Healthy fats  
Include regularly:

- Olive oil  
- Avocado  
- Nuts  
- Whole eggs  
- Oily fish  
- Grass-fed beef or lamb  
- Butter or ghee (moderate)

**Target:** ~30–40% of calories from fat.

### Protein  
Aim for **1.6–2.2 g/kg/day**.  
Supports muscle repair, blood sugar stability, and hormone signalling.

### Strategic carbohydrates  
Very low-carb diets can raise cortisol in some men.

Use carbs:

- Before training  
- After training  
- On heavy lifting days  

Sources: potatoes, rice, oats, fruit, legumes.

---

## 2. Training: Lift Heavy, Not Forever

Strength training is one of the strongest natural testosterone stimuli.

### Effective structure
- **3–4 sessions/week**  
- **45–60 minutes each**  
- **3–6 reps per set, heavy compound lifts**  

Focus on:

- Deadlifts  
- Squats  
- Bench press  
- Overhead press  
- Rows  
- Pull-ups  

### Avoid  
- Sessions >90 minutes  
- Chronic cardio  
- Daily maximal lifting without rest  

Overtraining elevates cortisol, reducing testosterone.

---

## 3. Sleep: The Largest Natural Lever

Up to **80% of daily testosterone** is produced during sleep.

### Suppressors of testosterone  
- <6 hours sleep  
- Night-time awakenings  
- Snoring or suspected sleep apnea  
- Late alcohol  
- Heavy late meals  

### Targets  
- 7.5–8.5 hours nightly  
- Cool, dark room  
- No screens in last hour  
- Stable wake time daily  

If snoring, choking, or severe fatigue occur → evaluate sleep apnea.

---

## 4. Body Composition: Reducing Visceral Fat

Visceral fat converts testosterone → estrogen via aromatase.

Reducing waist circumference by **5–10%** can significantly increase free testosterone.

Strategies:

- Progressive strength training  
- Higher protein intake  
- Moderate calorie deficit  
- Improved sleep + reduced alcohol  

---

## 5. Micronutrient Support: Closing the Gaps

### Vitamin D  
Low levels strongly correlate with lower testosterone.

### Zinc  
Required for LH production and androgen synthesis.

### Magnesium  
Improves sleep quality; may support free testosterone.

### Typical supplemental ranges  
- Vitamin D3: **2,000–5,000 IU/day**  
- Magnesium glycinate: **300–400 mg/night**  
- Zinc: **15–30 mg/day** (short-term)

Testing levels helps target supplementation.

---

## 6. Reducing Testosterone-Suppressing Inputs

Key suppressors:

- Frequent alcohol  
- Chronic unrelieved stress  
- Severe calorie restriction  
- Overtraining  
- Endocrine disruptors (plastics, pesticides, reheated packaging)

Reducing these improves hormonal resilience.

---

## 7. Behavioural and Environmental Drivers

### Sunlight  
Regulates circadian rhythm, vitamin D, nitric oxide pathways.

### Sexual activity  
Supports testosterone and LH signalling.

### Purpose + competition  
Progress, mastery, achievement → psychosocial testosterone signals.

Hormones respond to behaviour.

---

## 8. Optional Lab Evaluation

Useful tests:

- Total testosterone  
- Free testosterone  
- SHBG  
- LH + FSH  
- Estradiol  
- Prolactin  
- Vitamin D  
- Thyroid (TSH, Free T4, **T3**)  

Bloods can distinguish lifestyle-related low T from gland-level issues.

---

## 9. TRT: When It Is and Isn’t Appropriate

TRT can help true hypogonadism but:

- Suppresses natural production  
- Lowers fertility  
- Requires lifelong management  
- Raises hematocrit  
- Needs regular monitoring  

Lifestyle-first is appropriate for most men with low-normal levels.

---

## Summary

Natural testosterone optimisation improves:

- Energy  
- Strength  
- Mood  
- Libido  
- Sleep
