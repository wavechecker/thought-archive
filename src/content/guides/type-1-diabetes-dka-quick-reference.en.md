# Type 1 Diabetes: DKA Quick Reference (Recognise & Act)

**Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)** is a **medical emergency**. It develops when the body lacks insulin, builds up **ketones**, and becomes dehydrated/acidotic. Illness, missed insulin, or pump delivery problems are common triggers.

> **Never stop basal insulin.** Seek **urgent care** if symptoms are severe, you **can’t keep fluids down**, or ketones **keep rising** despite extra insulin and fluids.

## Warning signs
- **Thirst**, dry mouth, frequent urination  
- **Nausea/vomiting**, abdominal pain  
- **Deep/rapid breathing**, **fruity breath**, **drowsiness/confusion**  
- BGL often high, but be alert even if glucose isn’t very high in early illness

## Ketone checks (blood preferred)
- Check **any time you feel unwell**, are **vomiting**, or if BGL is **≥15 mmol/L**.  
- **Recheck every 1–2 hours** until ketones clear and symptoms improve.

### Typical action thresholds (general guidance — follow your personal plan)
- **<0.6 mmol/L:** likely normal. Continue fluids and monitoring.  
- **0.6–1.4 mmol/L:** **mild**. Increase **fluids** and consider **extra rapid-acting insulin** per your plan; recheck in **1–2 h**.  
- **1.5–2.9 mmol/L:** **moderate**. High risk; give **extra insulin**, take **unsweetened fluids**, recheck **hourly–2-hourly**, and **contact your diabetes team**.  
- **≥3.0 mmol/L** or worsening symptoms: **Emergency** → **go to hospital / call emergency services**.

## Fluids
- Aim to **prevent dehydration**: small, frequent sips (every 5–10 min).  
- If **BGL high / ketones present** → use **unsweetened fluids** (water, broths, sugar-free oral rehydration).  
- If **BGL low/normal** and you can’t eat → **carbohydrate-containing fluids** to avoid hypos.

## Insulin actions

### Pump users
- **Suspect site failure** if ketones are present:  
  1) Give a **correction bolus by pen/syringe** (to bypass the pump).  
  2) **Change infusion set and site**; check for kinks/air bubbles.  
  3) Consider **temporary basal increase** per your plan.  
  4) **Recheck BGL & ketones in 1–2 h**; seek urgent care if not improving.

### Injections (MDI)
- **Do not skip basal**.  
- Give **correction rapid-acting insulin** per your sick-day plan.  
- **Recheck** BGL & ketones in **1–2 h** and repeat per plan; seek help if not improving.

## Do / Don’t
- **Do:** keep testing; keep taking insulin; maintain fluids; act early.  
- **Don’t:** delay care with **persistent vomiting**, **worsening abdominal pain**, **drowsiness**, or **breathing changes** — **go to hospital**.

## For children and teens
- DKA can progress **quickly**. If vomiting or unable to keep fluids down, **seek urgent medical advice early**, even with moderate ketones. Ensure caregivers know the **sick-day plan**, where supplies are, and how to contact your diabetes team.
