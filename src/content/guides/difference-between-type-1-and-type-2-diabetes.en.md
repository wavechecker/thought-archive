# What is the Difference Between Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes?

## Overview
Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects how your body turns food into energy. There are two main types: **Type 1** and **Type 2**. While they share some symptoms, they have different causes, treatments, and long-term management strategies.

## Key Points
- **Type 1** is an autoimmune condition where the immune system attacks insulin-producing cells.
- **Type 2** develops when the body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn’t make enough of it.
- Both types require blood sugar monitoring but may differ in treatment approaches.
- Lifestyle changes are key for managing Type 2; insulin therapy is essential for Type 1.

## Causes and Mechanisms

### Type 1 Diabetes
- Caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking **beta cells** in the pancreas.
- Usually develops in childhood or adolescence, but can occur at any age.
- Not linked to lifestyle or diet.

### Type 2 Diabetes
- Develops gradually, often over years.
- The body’s cells become resistant to insulin, and the pancreas can’t keep up.
- Strongly linked to **overweight, inactivity, and genetics**.

## Symptoms
Symptoms are similar for both types, but may develop faster in Type 1.

- Frequent urination
- Extreme thirst
- Unexplained weight loss
- Fatigue
- Blurred vision
- Slow-healing wounds

## Diagnosis
A doctor may use:
- **Fasting blood glucose**
- **HbA1c test**
- **Oral glucose tolerance test**

## Treatment

### Type 1
- Lifelong insulin injections or pump therapy.
- Careful carbohydrate counting.
- Regular blood sugar monitoring.

### Type 2
- Lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, weight management).
- Oral medications (e.g., metformin).
- Insulin in later stages if needed.

## FAQs

**Q: Can Type 1 diabetes be prevented?**  
A: No. It is an autoimmune condition with no known prevention.

**Q: Can Type 2 diabetes be reversed?**  
A: In some cases, lifestyle changes and weight loss can return blood sugar levels to normal, especially if caught early.

**Q: Do both types need insulin?**  
A: Type 1 always requires insulin. Type 2 may require insulin if other treatments don’t keep blood sugar in target range.
