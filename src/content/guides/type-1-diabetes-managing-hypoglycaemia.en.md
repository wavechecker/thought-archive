# Type 1 Diabetes: Managing Low Blood Glucose (Hypoglycaemia)

**Hypoglycaemia** (a “hypo”) usually means **BGL < 4.0 mmol/L** in people using insulin. Treat **quickly** and **re-check** to avoid worsening lows. Always follow your **personal diabetes plan**; seek medical help if unsure or if recovery is not prompt.

> **Safety first:** If driving or operating machinery, **stop immediately** and treat the hypo. Do not resume until glucose has clearly recovered and you feel well.

## Recognise a hypo
- Shaking, sweating, hunger, tingling lips  
- Irritability, confusion, headache, blurred vision  
- In severe cases: **unable to swallow**, **unconscious**, or **seizure**

## Step-by-step treatment (mild–moderate hypo, able to swallow)
1) **Take 15 g fast-acting carbohydrate**, e.g. glucose tablets/gel, small juice, or regular soft drink.  
2) **Wait 15 minutes**, then **re-check BGL**.  
3) If still **< 4.0 mmol/L**, **repeat step 1** and re-check again after 15 minutes.  
4) Once recovered (≥4.0 and symptoms resolving), if the next meal is **>1 hour** away, take a **longer-acting snack** (e.g., sandwich, milk/yoghurt, fruit + crackers) to prevent another drop.

## Severe hypo (cannot swallow / unconscious / seizure)
- **Do NOT give food or drink by mouth.**  
- **Use glucagon** (nasal or injection) if available and trained to use it.  
- **Call emergency services.**  
- After recovery, **eat longer-acting carbohydrate** and contact your diabetes team to review insulin doses.

## If you have a hypo overnight
- Treat as above (15 g fast carb → recheck after 15 min → repeat if needed).  
- Take a **longer-acting snack** before returning to sleep.  
- Discuss **overnight basal adjustments** with your diabetes team if hypos are recurring.

## CGM vs no CGM
- **With CGM:** Treat based on **low alerts** and **your symptoms**. Confirm with finger-stick if readings don’t match how you feel, or after severe hypos.  
- **Without CGM:** Keep meter and hypo kit **with you**; test more often when unwell, after exercise, alcohol, or dose changes.

## Preventing future hypos
- Review insulin timing/doses with your clinician after any **severe** or **recurrent** hypo.  
- Adjust bolus around **exercise** (and carry hypo treatment).  
- During **illness**, balance insulin, fluids, and carb intake; avoid stacking rapid-acting insulin without planned carbs.

## When to seek medical help
- Repeated hypos or **no warning symptoms (“hypo unawareness”)**  
- **Severe hypo** needing glucagon/help from others  
- Hypos occurring with **vomiting**, **diarrhoea**, or **infection**  
- Any time you are **concerned** or unsure how to adjust insulin
