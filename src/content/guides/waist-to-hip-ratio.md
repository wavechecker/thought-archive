## Intro
Waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) compares the size of your waist to your hips. It’s a simple, low-cost way to estimate fat distribution — and research shows it predicts heart disease and diabetes risk more accurately than BMI.

## Key Points
- WHR = waist circumference ÷ hip circumference.  
- Higher WHR means more abdominal fat and higher metabolic risk.  
- Lower WHR means fat stored more on the hips/thighs, which is less risky.  

## Background
BMI has long been the standard measure for obesity, but it only reflects weight relative to height. It doesn’t show where fat is carried. Fat stored around the waist (visceral fat) is strongly linked to metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Measuring WHR provides a clearer picture of these risks.

## How to Measure
1. **Waist:** Place a tape measure around your bare abdomen, just above the hip bones (usually at belly-button level). Don’t suck in.  
2. **Hips:** Measure around the widest part of your buttocks.  
3. **Calculate:** Divide waist by hip (e.g., 90 cm ÷ 100 cm = WHR 0.9).  

## Interpretation (WHO guidance)
- **Men:** WHR > 0.90 = higher risk.  
- **Women:** WHR > 0.85 = higher risk.  

## Risks / Benefits
- **High WHR** → greater risk of heart attack, stroke, and type 2 diabetes.  
- **Lower WHR** → indicates fat distribution is less centered on the abdomen, lowering risk even if BMI is unchanged.  

## FAQ
**Q: Do I need special equipment?**  
A: No — a simple fabric or plastic tape measure is enough.  

**Q: Which is better, BMI or WHR?**  
A: WHR adds important context. BMI can flag overweight, but WHR shows if fat is concentrated in the abdomen (a stronger predictor of health risks).  

**Q: Should I track WHR over time?**  
A: Yes. Even small reductions in waist size relative to hips can reduce disease risk.
