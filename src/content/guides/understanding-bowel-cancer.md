# Understanding Bowel Cancer — Risks and Symptoms

Bowel cancer (also called colorectal cancer) is one of the most common cancers worldwide. It develops in the large intestine (colon or rectum) and usually starts from small growths called *polyps*. While not all polyps become cancerous, detecting and removing them early can prevent cancer from developing.

## Why Early Detection Matters
When bowel cancer is found at an early stage, treatment is much more effective and survival rates are significantly higher. Unfortunately, symptoms can be subtle or mistaken for less serious conditions, which is why screening and awareness are crucial.

## Key Risk Factors
- **Age**: Risk increases sharply after age 50.  
- **Family history**: Having a first-degree relative (parent, sibling, child) with bowel cancer.  
- **Genetics**: Certain inherited conditions (e.g., Lynch syndrome, FAP).  
- **Inflammatory bowel disease**: Long-standing ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease.  
- **Lifestyle factors**: Diet high in red or processed meat, low in fibre, sedentary lifestyle, obesity, smoking, and heavy alcohol use.  

---

## Red-Flag Symptoms
- Blood in the stool (may appear bright red or dark/tarry).  
- A change in bowel habits lasting more than a few weeks (diarrhoea, constipation, narrower stools).  
- Persistent abdominal pain, cramping, or bloating.  
- Unexplained weight loss or loss of appetite.  
- Fatigue or anaemia (from slow internal bleeding).  

⚠️ These symptoms don't always mean cancer, but they should never be ignored — especially if persistent.  

---

## Screening and Prevention
- **Screening tests**: Fecal occult blood test (FOBT) or fecal immunochemical test (FIT) are simple stool tests used in national screening programs.  
- **Colonoscopy**: If blood is detected, a colonoscopy can confirm the cause and remove any polyps before they progress.  
- **Prevention**: A healthy diet rich in fibre, regular exercise, limiting alcohol, and not smoking all reduce risk.

## Takeaway
Bowel cancer is common, but it's also highly preventable and treatable if detected early. Knowing the risks, recognising symptoms, and taking part in screening programs saves lives.
