# Understanding Bowel Cancer — Risks and Symptoms

Bowel cancer (also called colorectal cancer) affects the large intestine. Early detection is vital — outcomes improve dramatically when it’s found early.

## Key points
- Risks: age over 50, family history, inflammatory bowel disease, diet high in red/processed meat.  
- Symptoms: blood in stool, change in bowel habits, unexplained weight loss, persistent abdominal pain.  
- Early diagnosis saves lives — don’t ignore warning signs.
