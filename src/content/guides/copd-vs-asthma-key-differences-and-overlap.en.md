# COPD vs Asthma: Key Differences and Overlap

## Overview
COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and asthma are both chronic lung diseases that cause breathing difficulties. They can look similar, but their causes, progression, and treatment approaches are different.

## Key Points
- COPD is usually caused by long-term exposure to lung irritants, especially cigarette smoke.
- Asthma often begins in childhood and is linked to airway inflammation and sensitivity.
- Both can cause wheezing, cough, and shortness of breath.
- In some patients, features of both conditions are present — this is called **asthma-COPD overlap**.

## Causes

### COPD
- Most often caused by **smoking**.
- Long-term exposure to air pollution, dust, or workplace chemicals.
- Typically develops after age 40.

### Asthma
- Exact cause unknown, but involves genetic and environmental factors.
- Often triggered by allergens, cold air, exercise, or respiratory infections.
- Can start at any age, but often in childhood.

## Symptoms

| Symptom | COPD | Asthma |
|---------|------|--------|
| Shortness of breath | Common, worsens over time | Common, variable |
| Wheezing | Common | Common |
| Cough | Often with mucus | Often dry or with little mucus |
| Flare-ups | Triggered by infections, irritants | Triggered by allergens, exercise, cold air |

## Progression
- **COPD**: Gradually worsens over years. Lung damage is not fully reversible.
- **Asthma**: Symptoms can be fully reversible between attacks with proper treatment.

## Diagnosis
- Lung function tests (spirometry) measure airflow.
- Medical history and symptom patterns.
- Chest X-rays or CT scans may be used for COPD.

## Treatment

### COPD
- Smoking cessation.
- Inhaled bronchodilators and steroids.
- Pulmonary rehabilitation.
- Oxygen therapy in advanced cases.

### Asthma
- Inhaled corticosteroids as daily controller medication.
- Short-acting bronchodilators for quick relief.
- Trigger avoidance and allergy management.

## Overlap Syndrome
- Some patients have symptoms and test results of both diseases.
- Requires a tailored treatment plan.

## FAQs

**Q: Can asthma turn into COPD?**  
A: Asthma does not “turn into” COPD, but smokers with asthma are at higher risk of developing COPD.

**Q: Can both conditions exist together?**  
A: Yes — asthma-COPD overlap can occur, especially in older adults.

**Q: Which is more serious?**  
A: Both can be serious if untreated. COPD tends to worsen over time, while asthma can often be controlled effectively.
