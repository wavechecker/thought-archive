# Carbohydrate Counting — Matching Insulin to Your Meals

## Why this matters
Carb counting helps you give the **right bolus** and reduce glucose swings. Over time, you can flexibly enjoy most foods with confidence.

## Core concepts
- **Insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio (ICR):** e.g., 1 unit per 10 g carbs.  
- **Correction factor** (insulin sensitivity): how much 1 unit drops your BGL.  
- **Active insulin** time: avoid “stacking” rapid-acting doses too close together.

> Use the ratios your diabetes team set for you. Everyone’s numbers differ.

## How to count carbs
- **Read labels:** subtract **fibre** according to your plan; use **per serve** or **per 100 g** carefully.  
- **Portion estimation:** measuring cups, digital scale, visual guides (palm, fist).  
- **Apps and food databases** help when eating out.  
- **Glycaemic impact:** fat/protein can **delay** glucose rise; consider split/extended bolus (pumps) or timing adjustments (MDI).

## Timing the bolus
- Rapid-acting insulin usually **0–15 min before eating**; earlier for higher-GI meals.  
- For mixed/high-fat meals, consider **split dose** or **extended bolus** (pump) per your plan.

## Common pitfalls
- Guessing portions without learning reference sizes  
- Forgetting **hidden carbs** (sauces, beverages)  
- Bolusing **after** eating high-GI meals (spikes)  
- Not adjusting for **exercise** or **illness**

## When to seek help
- Large after-meal spikes or frequent post-meal **lows**  
- Weight change, new activity levels, or major diet changes  
- Need help **setting/adjusting** your ICR or correction factor
