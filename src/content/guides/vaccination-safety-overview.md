# Vaccination Safety Overview

## Intro
Vaccine safety has been studied more extensively than almost any other medical intervention. Surveillance systems around the world monitor side effects, while myths and misinformation continue to challenge public confidence. This section brings together guides addressing safety, controversies, and trust in vaccines.

## Key Points
- Vaccines undergo rigorous pre-approval testing and continuous post-marketing monitoring.  
- Large studies consistently show no link between vaccines and autism.  
- Aluminum adjuvants are safe at vaccine doses; myths persist despite extensive evidence.  
- Adverse events are monitored globally through systems like VAERS (US), EudraVigilance (EU), and AusVaxSafety (Australia).  
- Vaccine hesitancy remains a significant public health challenge.
