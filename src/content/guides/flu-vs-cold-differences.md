## Intro
Colds and flu are both respiratory infections, but **influenza** tends to start suddenly, hit harder, and cause higher fever and body aches. Knowing the differences helps you decide on testing, antivirals, and when to seek care.

## Key Points
- **Onset:** Flu = **sudden**; Cold = **gradual**.  
- **Fever & aches:** Flu = **higher fever & prominent body aches**; Cold = milder.  
- **Cough:** Both can cough; flu cough often deeper and more exhausting.  
- **Sore throat/runny nose:** More prominent with **colds**.  
- **Antivirals:** Flu may benefit from **early antivirals** (within 48 hours for higher-risk groups).  
- **Testing:** Consider if symptoms are severe, you’re high-risk, or during known flu waves.

## Symptom Comparison

| Feature | Flu (Influenza) | Common Cold |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Onset | **Abrupt** (hours) | **Gradual** (1–2 days) |
| Fever | **High (≥38°C / 100.4°F)** common | Low-grade or none |
| Aches & chills | **Prominent** | Mild |
| Fatigue | **Marked**, can be prolonged | Mild–moderate |
| Headache | **Common** | Less common |
| Sore throat | Sometimes | **Common** |
| Runny/stuffy nose | Sometimes | **Common** |
| Cough | **Common, can be severe** | Common, milder |

## When to Test
- Severe symptoms or **high-risk** (pregnancy, age ≥65, chronic heart/lung/kidney disease, diabetes, immunocompromise).  
- Outbreak exposure (household, school, workplace) during flu season.  
- If results will change management (e.g., antivirals, isolation).

## Treatment
- **Flu:** Rest, fluids, fever relief (paracetamol/acetaminophen or ibuprofen if appropriate).  
  - **Antivirals (e.g., oseltamivir)** may be recommended for high-risk patients or severe disease, ideally **within 48 hours** of symptom onset.  
- **Cold:** Symptomatic care—fluids, saline nasal rinse, honey for cough (age >1), decongestants/lozenges as appropriate.

> **Antibiotics do not treat viral infections** like flu or colds.

## Red Flags — Seek Urgent Care
- Difficulty breathing, chest pain, bluish lips/face.  
- Confusion, severe dehydration, fainting.  
- **Persistent high fever** (>3 days) or fever that improves then **returns with worse cough**.  
- In children: fast/labored breathing, lethargy, poor intake/urine, or any cyanosis.  
- In infants <3 months: **any fever ≥38.0°C**.

## Recovery & Prevention
- Most colds resolve in **7–10 days**; flu may take **1–2 weeks** (fatigue can linger).  
- **Vaccination:** Annual flu shot reduces risk of severe disease.  
- **Reduce spread:** Stay home when unwell, hand hygiene, cover coughs, consider a mask in crowded indoor spaces when symptomatic.

## FAQ
**How do I know it’s flu without a test?**  
The combination of **sudden onset, high fever, and body aches** during flu season strongly suggests flu, but testing is the only way to be sure.

**Do I need antivirals?**  
If you’re at **higher risk** or have severe disease, speak to a clinician **as soon as symptoms start**—treatment works best early.

**Can you have flu without a fever?**  
Yes, especially in older adults or those on certain medications—but it’s less common.
