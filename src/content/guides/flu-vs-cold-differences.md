Both **influenza (flu)** and the **common cold** are viral respiratory infections — but flu tends to hit **hard and fast**, while colds are usually milder.

## Quick comparison
- **Onset:** Flu often **sudden**; colds **gradual**.
- **Fever:** Flu **common (often high)**; colds **uncommon or low‑grade**.
- **Aches:** Flu **prominent muscle aches**; colds **mild**.
- **Fatigue:** Flu **marked**; colds **mild to moderate**.
- **Nose/throat:** Colds **more congestion/sore throat**; flu may have dry cough early.
- **Complications:** Flu can cause **pneumonia** or worsen chronic illness.

## When to test or seek care
- **High fever**, **shortness of breath**, chest pain, confusion, dehydration.
- Adults 65+, pregnancy, chronic heart/lung disease, diabetes, or weakened immunity.
- Antiviral treatment is **time‑sensitive** — earlier is better for those at risk.

## Prevention & self‑care
- **Annual flu vaccination** (best single preventive step).
- Hand hygiene; avoid close contact when ill.
- Rest, fluids, pain/fever relief as advised by your clinician.
