## Intro
Most people focus on the number on the scale. But during weight loss — especially rapid weight loss with GLP-1 medications like Ozempic — **what you lose** matters as much as **how much you lose**.

Losing **fat** improves health.  
Losing **muscle** can quietly make things worse.

This guide explains why **lean muscle is critical**, how weight-loss drugs can accelerate muscle loss, and the practical steps to preserve or build muscle while losing fat.

<SummaryBox title="Key points" icon="💪">
- Muscle is a major driver of metabolic health, strength, and long-term independence.  
- Any aggressive diet or GLP-1 drug can reduce lean muscle if protein and training are neglected.  
- Muscle loss slows metabolism and increases the risk of weight regain when treatment stops.  
- You can protect muscle with higher protein intake, resistance training, and avoiding extreme calorie deficits.

## Why Muscle Matters in Weight Loss

Muscle is more than “tone” or aesthetics. It:

- helps control blood sugar and insulin sensitivity  
- supports joints and bone health  
- maintains balance and reduces falls  
- keeps resting metabolic rate higher  
- protects long-term independence and quality of life  

<RiskBadge level="moderate">Losing muscle increases frailty and injury risk</RiskBadge>
<RiskBadge level="moderate">Low muscle mass predicts worse health outcomes</RiskBadge>

When weight loss comes from muscle instead of fat, the body becomes **lighter but weaker**, **smaller but less resilient**.

## How GLP-1 Medications Can Affect Muscle

GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic, Wegovy, and tirzepatide help people eat less and lose weight by:

- suppressing appetite  
- slowing stomach emptying  
- changing reward signals around food  

These effects are powerful, but not selective. They reduce:

- **total calories**  
- **protein intake** (often unintentionally)  

Without enough protein and resistance training, the body breaks down **muscle and fat together**.

<RiskBadge level="high">Rapid weight loss without strength training</RiskBadge>
<RiskBadge level="moderate">Low protein intake while on GLP-1 medication</RiskBadge>

Clinical trials show that people on GLP-1 medications lose both **fat mass** and **lean mass**. Fat loss is usually greater — which is positive — but the lean-mass loss is still significant enough to affect strength and metabolism.

## Signs You May Be Losing Muscle

You may be losing muscle if you notice:

- reduced strength (e.g. struggling with weights that used to feel easy)  
- fatigue when climbing stairs or carrying groceries  
- shrinking thighs, hips, or shoulders even more than the waist  
- feeling “soft” or weaker despite weight loss  
- rapid weight loss with very low food intake (under 800–1000 kcal/day)  

<RiskBadge level="high">Rapid weight loss with weakness or dizziness</RiskBadge>

## How to Protect Muscle While Losing Fat

### 1. Prioritise Protein

Aim for **1.2–1.6 g of protein per kg of body weight per day** during weight loss, unless your clinician advises otherwise.

For an 80 kg adult, that’s roughly **95–130 g of protein daily**.

Good sources:

- eggs, fish, chicken, lean meat  
- Greek yoghurt, cottage cheese, milk  
- tofu, tempeh, lentils, beans  
- whey or plant-based protein powders  

Spread protein across **3–4 meals** instead of one large serving.

If you are losing weight and eating mostly snacks, toast, or low-protein meals, it is very likely that **you are losing muscle as well as fat**.

### 2. Do Resistance Training 2–4 Times per Week

Resistance or strength training tells your body:

> “This muscle is needed. Keep it.”

It can include:

- free weights (dumbbells, barbells, kettlebells)  
- machines at the gym  
- resistance bands  
- bodyweight exercises (squats, push-ups, rows)  

Focus on **big compound movements** that work several muscle groups:

- squats or leg presses  
- deadlifts or hip hinges  
- presses (bench, overhead)  
- rows and pull-downs  

Start light, focus on form, and progress gradually.

<RiskBadge level="low">2–3 short strength sessions per week already help</RiskBadge>

### 3. Avoid Severe Calorie Restriction

Very low-calorie diets (often called “crash diets”) increase the risk of muscle loss, fatigue, and binge episodes later.

If you are:

- frequently dizzy or light-headed  
- eating very small meals to “save calories”  
- routinely under 800–1000 kcal/day  

…it is likely too aggressive.

Talk with your clinician about:

- adjusting your GLP-1 dose  
- adding a small pre- or post-workout snack  
- working with a dietitian to set realistic intake targets  

---

### 4. Consider Evidence-Based Supplements

Not everyone needs supplements, but a few have good evidence for muscle protection during weight loss:

- **Creatine monohydrate**  
  - supports strength, power, and lean mass  
  - generally safe for healthy kidneys at standard doses  

- **Adequate vitamin D and protein**  
  - vitamin D supports muscle and bone health  
  - blood tests can guide safe supplementation  

Ask your clinician before starting any new supplement, especially if you have kidney, liver, or heart issues.

### 5. Pay Attention When Stopping GLP-1 Medications

When you reduce or stop a GLP-1 medication:

- appetite usually returns quickly  
- hunger and cravings can feel stronger than before  
- if muscle was lost, your metabolism may be slightly lower  

This combination makes **weight regain more likely**.

A muscle-protection plan helps:

- continued resistance training  
- maintaining higher protein intake  
- regular meals instead of “all or nothing” eating  
- follow-up with your clinician or dietitian

## FAQ

**Q: Can I build muscle while using Ozempic or other GLP-1 drugs?**  
A: Yes, especially if you are new to strength training. With enough protein and consistent resistance exercise, some people do gain muscle while losing fat.

**Q: I don’t like gyms. Can I still protect muscle?**  
A: Yes. Bodyweight training, resistance bands, or simple at-home weights are enough for many people, especially in the beginning.

**Q: How fast is “too fast” for weight loss?**  
A: It varies, but losing more than about 0.5–1.0 kg per week for many weeks increases the risk of muscle loss, fatigue, and nutrient deficiencies.

**Q: Do I need a personal trainer?**  
A: Not necessarily, but a few sessions can be helpful for learning safe form and building confidence, especially if you are new to strength training.
