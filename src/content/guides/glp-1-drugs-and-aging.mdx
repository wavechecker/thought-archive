## Intro

GLP-1 drugs are now central to obesity and metabolic medicine — and they’re increasingly discussed as potential “longevity” drugs. This guide will map what’s known, what’s plausible, and what’s still unknown.

## Key Points

- GLP-1 drugs have strong evidence for metabolic outcomes
- “Longevity” effects are mostly indirect and still being studied
- Any benefits likely come through reduced cardiometabolic risk

## FAQ

**Q: What are GLP-1 drugs?**  
A: Medications used for diabetes/obesity that reduce appetite and improve metabolic control.

**Q: Why might they affect aging?**  
A: They may reduce chronic metabolic stress and inflammation linked to age-related disease.

**Q: Do they extend lifespan?**  
A: Not definitively proven in humans; strongest evidence is for improved cardiometabolic outcomes.
