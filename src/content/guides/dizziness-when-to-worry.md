# Common Causes of Dizziness and When to Worry

"Dizziness" covers spinning (vertigo), lightheadedness, or imbalance. Most causes are benign, but some are emergencies.

## Summary
Brief spinning with head movement often indicates BPPV; add red-flag symptoms (stroke signs, chest pain, severe headache) and it becomes urgent.

## Common causes
- **BPPV:** brief spinning triggered by rolling over or looking up  
- **Vestibular neuritis/labyrinthitis:** inner-ear inflammation from a virus  
- **Low blood pressure/dehydration:** standing too quickly, illness, meds  
- **Migraine:** with or without headache  
- **Anemia, low blood sugar, medication side effects**

## Red flags — seek urgent care
- **Sudden severe dizziness** with **speech trouble, weakness, facial droop, vision loss** (possible stroke)  
- **New, worst headache**, neck stiffness, confusion  
- **Chest pain, palpitations, or fainting**  
- **Persistent vomiting** or inability to keep fluids down

## Self-care for mild symptoms
- Hydrate; rise slowly; avoid driving until steady  
- Review meds (BP pills, sedatives) with your clinician  
- Clinicians may teach **Epley** or other maneuvers for BPPV

## FAQs
**How do I know if it's vertigo?** Spinning made worse by head movement suggests vertigo.  
**Can anxiety cause dizziness?** Yes—after other causes are ruled out.
