# Mental Health Toolkit

*[← Back to Mental Health Hub](/guides/mental-health)*

Medications and therapy help millions manage depression, anxiety, and other conditions. But science shows that **lifestyle and daily habits also have a powerful influence on mental health**.  

These strategies are not replacements for professional care — but they can be valuable **adjuncts** that build resilience, reduce risk, and improve quality of life.

## How to Use This Toolkit

- **Start small.** Choose one habit (better sleep, a daily walk, or light therapy) and build from there.  
- **Stack habits.** Research shows that keeping at least **five healthy lifestyle practices** can cut depression risk by half.  
- **Combine approaches.** These strategies complement — not replace — therapy, medication, or crisis support.  

Think of the toolkit as a set of levers: the more you pull together, the stronger your resilience becomes.
