## Intro
Shortness of breath (dyspnoea) can occur with exercise, heat, or anxiety — but when it happens unexpectedly, worsens, or doesn’t resolve with rest, it may signal a **serious underlying problem**. Some causes require **immediate emergency care**.

## Key Points
- Breathlessness that is **sudden, severe, or unexplained** is always a red flag.  
- Associated chest pain, fainting, or blue lips = **call emergency services immediately**.  
- Gradual worsening may point to chronic heart or lung disease.  
- Breathlessness interfering with daily life should always be checked.  

## 5 Warning Signs You Shouldn’t Ignore
1. **Sudden onset without clear cause** — If you’re resting or doing light activity and suddenly feel breathless, it could point to heart attack, blood clot in the lungs (pulmonary embolism), or severe asthma.  
2. **Worsening over days or weeks** — A gradual decline may signal asthma, COPD, heart failure, or anaemia.  
3. **Associated chest pain or tightness** — Pain, heaviness, or pressure in the chest plus breathlessness = urgent evaluation.  
4. **Blue lips or fingertips** — A bluish tint suggests low oxygen in the blood — a medical emergency.  
5. **Interference with daily activities** — Difficulty climbing stairs, walking short distances, or speaking in full sentences is not normal.  

## Possible Causes
- **Heart-related**: heart attack, heart failure, arrhythmia.  
- **Lung-related**: asthma, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, COPD.  
- **Blood-related**: anaemia, low oxygen levels.  
- **Other**: anxiety, panic attacks, high altitude.  

## What to Do
- **Call emergency services** if shortness of breath is sudden, severe, or associated with chest pain, dizziness, or fainting.  
- For gradual or chronic symptoms, book a medical review promptly.  
- Never ignore breathlessness that limits daily activities.  

## FAQ
**Q: When is shortness of breath an emergency?**  
A: If it comes on suddenly, is severe, or is accompanied by chest pain, fainting, or blue lips — call emergency services.  

**Q: Can anxiety cause breathlessness?**  
A: Yes. Panic attacks can cause shortness of breath, but it should never be assumed to be the cause until serious problems are ruled out.  

**Q: What tests might a doctor order?**  
A: ECG, chest X-ray, blood tests, lung function testing, or CT scan depending on the suspected cause.
