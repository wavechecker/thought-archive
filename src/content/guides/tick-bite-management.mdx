## Intro
Tick bites are common in wooded and grassy areas. Most are harmless, but some can transmit infections such as Lyme disease. Knowing what to do after a bite reduces risk and anxiety.

## Key Points
- Remove ticks promptly with fine-tipped tweezers.  
- Transmission risk rises with longer attachment times.  
- Watch for rash, fever, or flu-like illness over the next 30 days.  
- Seek medical advice if a rash appears, symptoms develop, or the bite was high-risk.  

## Background
Different regions have different tick species and tick-borne diseases. Local public health advice should guide specific prevention and treatment strategies.

## Immediate Steps After a Bite
- Remove the tick with tweezers (close to the skin, steady upward pull).  
- Clean the area with soap and water or antiseptic.  
- Note the date, location of the bite, and—if possible—how long the tick was attached.

## When to Consider Medical Advice
- Tick attached for ≥36–48 hours in a known Lyme-endemic area  
- An expanding rash at or near the bite site  
- Fever, chills, severe headache, neck stiffness, joint pain, or facial drooping  
- Multiple bites or uncertainty about the species or duration  

## FAQ
**Q: Should I keep the tick?**  
A: In some regions, ticks can be identified or tested, but negative tests do not completely rule out infection. Follow local guidance.

**Q: Should everyone get antibiotics after a tick bite?**  
A: No. Prophylactic antibiotics are considered only after specific high-risk bites and depend on local guidelines.
