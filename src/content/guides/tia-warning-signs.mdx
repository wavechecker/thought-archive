# Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA): A Serious Stroke Warning

A **Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)** happens when blood flow to part of the brain is briefly blocked.  
It causes **stroke-like symptoms that resolve within minutes or hours**.

Although symptoms disappear, a TIA is **not harmless**.

A TIA is a **medical emergency** and a **strong warning sign** of a future stroke.

---

## Why a TIA Matters

- Many full strokes occur **within hours or days** of a TIA  
- Early treatment can **prevent permanent brain damage**  
- Ignoring a TIA can lead to a **major, disabling stroke**

Think of a TIA as your brain’s **early warning alarm**.

## TIA Symptoms: Use FAST

TIA symptoms are the **same as stroke symptoms**.

Remember **FAST**:

- **F — Face:** drooping or numbness on one side  
- **A — Arms:** weakness or inability to raise both arms  
- **S — Speech:** slurred, confused, or strange speech  
- **T — Time:** call emergency services **immediately**

Other possible symptoms include:
- Sudden vision problems
- Sudden confusion or difficulty understanding speech
- Sudden dizziness or loss of balance
- Sudden severe headache with no known cause

If these symptoms occur — **even briefly** — seek emergency care.

<aside class="explainer-box">
  <h3>Mini-stroke is a misleading name</h3>
  <p><strong>A TIA is a stroke warning sign, not a "small stroke you can ignore."</strong></p>
  <p>
    Symptoms can disappear, but the risk of a major stroke can be highest in the next hours and days.
    That's why emergency assessment matters even if you feel normal again.

## If Symptoms Go Away, What Should You Do?

Even if symptoms completely resolve:
- **Call emergency services**
- Do **not** wait for a GP appointment
- Do **not** assume it was “nothing”

Doctors can:
- Identify the cause
- Start medications to reduce stroke risk
- Arrange further testing or procedures if needed

---

## What Happens After a TIA?

Evaluation may include:
- Brain imaging
- Heart rhythm monitoring
- Blood tests
- Medication review

Treatment often focuses on **preventing a future stroke**, which may involve:
- Blood pressure control
- Blood thinners or antiplatelet medication
- Cholesterol treatment
- Lifestyle changes

Follow-up care is critical.

---

## Can TIA Happen at Any Age?

Yes. TIA can occur in:
- Older adults
- Young adults
- People without obvious risk factors

Any sudden neurological symptoms at **any age** should be treated as an emergency.

---

## Bottom Line

A TIA is **not a false alarm**.

It is a **chance to prevent a major stroke** — but only if acted on immediately.

If you suspect a TIA, **call emergency services right away**.
