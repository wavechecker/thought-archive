# Understanding HbA1c and Why It Matters for Diabetes Management

## Overview
The HbA1c test measures your average blood sugar (glucose) levels over the past 2–3 months. It’s a key tool for diagnosing diabetes, monitoring treatment, and predicting the risk of complications.

## Key Points
- HbA1c reflects **long-term** blood sugar control, unlike daily glucose checks.
- The test is expressed as a percentage.
- Higher results mean higher average blood sugar levels.
- Recommended for both **Type 1** and **Type 2** diabetes monitoring.

## What is HbA1c?
- HbA1c stands for **glycated hemoglobin**.
- Glucose naturally attaches to hemoglobin in red blood cells.
- Since red blood cells live about 120 days, the test shows a 2–3 month average.

## What the Results Mean
| HbA1c (%) | Interpretation |
|-----------|---------------|
| Below 5.7 | Normal |
| 5.7 – 6.4 | Prediabetes |
| 6.5 or above | Diabetes |

For people with diabetes, most guidelines recommend:
- **Target HbA1c**: Below 7% (individual targets may vary).

## Why HbA1c Matters
- Shows how well treatment is working over time.
- Helps guide medication changes.
- Predicts the risk of long-term complications like kidney disease, nerve damage, and vision loss.

## Factors That Can Affect Results
- Anemia or blood disorders.
- Recent blood transfusions.
- Certain kidney or liver conditions.

## How Often to Test
- At least twice a year if your blood sugar is stable.
- Every 3 months if treatment changes or targets aren’t being met.

## FAQs

**Q: Is HbA1c the same as a daily finger-prick test?**  
A: No — finger-prick tests measure current blood sugar; HbA1c is an average over months.

**Q: Can I lower my HbA1c quickly?**  
A: Gradual changes over weeks to months are most effective and safest.

**Q: Does HbA1c testing require fasting?**  
A: No — you can have the test at any time of day.
