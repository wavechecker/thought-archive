## Intro
Lyme disease is a bacterial infection caused by *Borrelia burgdorferi* and transmitted through the bite of infected **Ixodes** ticks (black-legged or deer ticks). Early detection and treatment are highly effective. Without treatment, the infection can spread to joints, nerves, and the heart.

## Key Points
- Caused by *Borrelia burgdorferi* (and in Europe, *B. afzelii* and *B. garinii*).  
- Spread through **Ixodes** ticks; transmission usually requires ≥36–48 hours of attachment.  
- Early symptoms include **erythema migrans** (bull’s-eye rash), fever, fatigue, and muscle aches.  
- Diagnosed with **clinical assessment + two-tier serology**.  
- Most cases respond well to 10–28 days of antibiotics.  
- A small group experience persistent symptoms (post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome), but active infection is rarely found.

## Background
Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne infection in North America and Europe. Risk is seasonal (spring–autumn) and linked to wooded and grassy areas where ticks feed on small mammals and deer.

## Causes or Mechanisms
Lyme disease is caused by spirochete bacteria transmitted during a tick blood meal. Once inside the body, *Borrelia* spreads through the skin and bloodstream, causing local inflammation and sometimes disseminating to other organs.

Tick attachment under 24 hours has **very low** transmission risk; the likelihood rises sharply after 36–48 hours.

## Diagnosis / Treatment / Options

### Diagnosis
Diagnosis uses a combination of:
- **Clinical signs** (particularly the erythema migrans rash — no test needed)  
- **Two-tier serology:**  
  - ELISA screening test  
  - Western blot confirmation  

PCR is occasionally used for joint fluid but is not standard for blood.

### Treatment
Standard antibiotic courses (examples):
- **Doxycycline** 100 mg twice daily for 10–21 days  
- **Amoxicillin** or **cefuroxime** for those who cannot take doxycycline  
- **IV ceftriaxone** for some neurological or cardiac cases  

Longer or repeated antibiotic courses are **not proven effective** and carry risks (C. difficile, line infections).

## Risks / Benefits / Prognosis
- With early treatment, prognosis is excellent.  
- Joint inflammation (Lyme arthritis) can take months to fully resolve even after the infection is cleared.  
- **Post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS)** affects a minority (fatigue, pain, brain fog) but **does not imply ongoing infection**.  
- Cardiac involvement is rare and usually reversible with treatment.

## What To Do After a Tick Bite

## FAQ
**Q: Can you get Lyme disease without seeing a tick?**  
A: Yes. Many people never notice the tick.

**Q: Is chronic Lyme disease real?**  
A: Persistent symptoms after treatment exist (PTLDS), but prolonged active infection has not been demonstrated in well-controlled studies.

**Q: Can blood tests be negative early on?**  
A: Yes. Early serology may be negative; repeat testing is recommended if suspicion remains high.
