## Intro
Azelastine is a long-established antihistamine nasal spray, widely used for hay fever and allergic rhinitis. A phase 2 clinical trial published in *JAMA Internal Medicine* (September 2025) tested whether it could reduce SARS-CoV-2 infections. The results showed a modest but statistically significant reduction in infections — raising interest in repurposing an over-the-counter allergy spray for COVID-19 prevention.

## Key Points
- Trial of 450 healthy adults: **2.2% infections with azelastine vs 6.7% with placebo**.  
- This equals about **5 fewer infections per 100 people treated**.  
- Use was **3× daily for 56 days**; higher dosing if exposed/symptomatic.  
- Side effects: bitter taste, nosebleeds, mild fatigue.  
- **Industry-funded** by the spray’s manufacturer (Ursapharm).  
- Results are promising but preliminary; larger independent trials are needed.  

## Background
Azelastine is a second-generation antihistamine, normally marketed for allergic rhinitis. In laboratory studies, it has shown antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, rhinovirus, and other respiratory viruses. Researchers designed the CONTAIN trial to test its role in *pre-exposure prophylaxis* against COVID-19.

## Trial Findings
- **Primary outcome**: SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by PCR.  
- **Results**: Azelastine 5/227 vs placebo 15/223. Odds ratio 0.31, *P* = 0.02.  
- **Secondary outcomes**: fewer symptomatic infections, longer time to infection, fewer rhinovirus cases.  
- **Limitations**: single center, modest sample size, mostly young vaccinated participants, industry sponsorship.  

## Risks and Safety
Azelastine’s safety profile was consistent with known use in allergies. Mild side effects were more frequent than placebo but no serious treatment-related harms occurred. Continuous long-term use for infection prevention has not been tested.

## Off-Label Use
Azelastine is **not licensed for COVID-19 prevention**. Any use in this setting is experimental. The trial explored both prevention and early treatment strategies, raising questions about how such a product might be used outside controlled studies.

## FAQ
**Q: Is this a miracle spray?**  
A: No. The benefit was modest — preventing about 5 infections per 100 people.  

**Q: Should I start using it now?**  
A: No health authority currently recommends azelastine for COVID-19 prevention. More evidence is needed.  

**Q: What about other respiratory viruses?**  
A: The trial suggested fewer rhinovirus infections, but larger studies are required.
