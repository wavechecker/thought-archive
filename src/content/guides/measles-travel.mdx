faq:
  - q: "Why is measles risk higher during international travel?"
    a: "Measles spreads through the air, and airports, planes, and crowded indoor travel settings increase exposure. Travel can also introduce measles into communities with lower vaccination coverage."
  - q: "How early should I get the MMR vaccine before travel?"
    a: "Get vaccinated as early as possible before departure. A clinician can advise on timing based on your age, prior doses, and destination."
  - q: "What should I do if I was exposed while traveling?"
    a: "Contact local health services or your clinician promptly. Post-exposure recommendations depend on your immunity status and how recently the exposure occurred."

# Measles and International Travel

## Intro
International travel increases measles exposure risk because the virus is airborne and spreads easily in crowded indoor settings like airports, aircraft cabins, public transport, and waiting rooms.

Before travel, the most important step is confirming **measles immunity** (typically **2 MMR doses**).

See also: **[Measles (Rubeola)](/guides/measles)** and **[Measles Vaccine (MMR/MMRV)](/guides/measles-vaccine)**.

## Key Points
- Travel can **increase exposure** and seed outbreaks across borders
- Confirm you have **2 documented MMR doses** (or other proof of immunity)
- Plan ahead: vaccine timing matters
- Infants and immunocompromised travelers need special planning

## Travel Risk Stratification

**High risk:**
- Unvaccinated / no proof of immunity
- Travel to areas with active outbreaks
- Infants and young children traveling

**Medium risk:**
- One documented MMR dose

**Low risk:**
- Two documented MMR doses / clear immunity

## Pre-Travel Checklist
1) Locate your vaccination record (aim: **2 MMR doses**)
2) If uncertain, book a pre-travel medical visit
3) Consider destination risk (outbreaks, crowding, healthcare access)
4) Plan contingencies: insurance, telehealth access, local clinics

## Special Groups

### Infants and Young Children
Measles risk is highest in infants and unvaccinated children. In some travel scenarios, clinicians may recommend an **early dose** for infants (destination- and country-dependent), followed by routine doses later.

### Immunocompromised Travelers
If you are immunocompromised, live vaccines may be contraindicated. Risk reduction can include:
- Avoiding high-crowd settings where possible
- Coordinating travel plans with your clinician
- Ensuring close contacts are vaccinated

### Pregnancy
If pregnant, MMR is typically avoided. Risk management focuses on:
- Confirming immunity pre-pregnancy if possible
- Avoiding high-risk destinations during active outbreaks
- Rapid post-exposure assessment

See: **[Measles and Pregnancy](/guides/measles-pregnancy)**.

## During Travel: Reducing Risk
- Be cautious in crowded indoor areas during outbreaks
- Consider masking in high-risk situations (context-dependent)
- Avoid close contact with sick people
- Seek medical advice early if fever + rash develops

## If You're Exposed While Traveling
1) Contact local health services or your clinician **promptly**
2) Provide exposure timing/location, immunity status, and symptoms
3) Follow public health guidance on monitoring and isolation

## Symptoms to Watch For
Early:
- Fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes
Later:
- Koplik spots
- Rash starting on the face and spreading downward

If symptoms begin, avoid crowded areas and call ahead before attending clinics.

## FAQ
**Q: Is measles still common in some countries?**
A: Outbreaks can happen anywhere immunity gaps exist, and travel connects those gaps quickly.

**Q: Can I travel if I only had one MMR dose?**
A: Possibly, but two doses offer stronger protection. Discuss with a clinician if traveling to areas reporting outbreaks.

**Q: Are airports and airplanes high risk?**
A: They can be. Crowded indoor environments increase exposure opportunities for airborne viruses.
