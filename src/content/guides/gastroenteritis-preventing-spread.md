# Understanding Gastroenteritis and Preventing Spread

**Gastroenteritis** ("stomach flu") is inflammation of the stomach and intestines, usually caused by viruses, bacteria, or parasites.  

It spreads quickly in households, childcare centres, and aged care settings — but it's usually short-lived.

---

## Symptoms
- Diarrhoea (watery or frequent stools)  
- Vomiting  
- Stomach cramps  
- Mild fever  
- Fatigue and loss of appetite  

Most people recover in a few days with rest and fluids.

---

## Causes
- **Viruses:** Norovirus (common outbreaks), Rotavirus (mainly in children)  
- **Bacteria:** Salmonella, Campylobacter, E. coli  
- **Other:** Contaminated food/water, poor hand hygiene, parasites (e.g., Giardia)  

---

## Prevention
- Wash hands with **soap and water** (alcohol gel is less effective for Norovirus)  
- Avoid preparing food for others while sick and for at least **48 hours after symptoms stop**  
- Disinfect contaminated surfaces (bleach-based cleaners work best)  
- Cook meat and seafood thoroughly; avoid unpasteurised foods  

---

## Self-Care
- **Fluids:** Small, frequent sips of water or oral rehydration solution (ORS)  
- **Food:** Start with bland foods (rice, toast, banana) once vomiting settles  
- **Children:** Monitor hydration closely (wet nappies, tears when crying, alertness)  

---

## When to Seek Help
- Blood in stool or vomit  
- Signs of dehydration (dizziness, very dark urine, no urination in 8+ hrs)  
- High fever (>39°C / 102°F)  
- Symptoms lasting >3–4 days, or in infants/elderly who deteriorate quickly
