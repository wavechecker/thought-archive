# Diabetes Hub

"Diabetes" is not a single disease. It is an umbrella term for several conditions that share one feature -- chronically elevated blood glucose -- but differ in cause, biology, and treatment. The two most common forms, **Type 1 diabetes** and **Type 2 diabetes**, are fundamentally different conditions that happen to share a name.

This page explains what separates them, why the distinction matters, and defines the core terminology used across all types of diabetes. For detailed guidance on either condition, follow the links to the dedicated hubs below.

## Type 1 vs Type 2 diabetes

Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes are often discussed as though they sit on the same spectrum. They do not. They have different causes, different mechanisms, and different treatment requirements.

| | Type 1 | Type 2 |
|---|---|---|
| **What goes wrong** | The immune system destroys the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas | The body's cells become resistant to insulin, and beta-cell function gradually declines |
| **Insulin production** | Little to none -- the pancreas can no longer make insulin | Still present initially, but insufficient to overcome resistance; declines over time |
| **Typical onset** | Often childhood or young adulthood, but can occur at any age | Usually adulthood, though increasingly diagnosed in younger populations |
| **Primary treatment** | Insulin replacement (always required, from diagnosis) | Lifestyle modification, oral and injectable medications, and sometimes insulin |
| **Can it be prevented?** | No known prevention | Risk can be substantially reduced through lifestyle changes |
| **Proportion of cases** | ~5--10% of all diabetes | ~90--95% of all diabetes |

Other forms of diabetes also exist, including gestational diabetes (during pregnancy), LADA (latent autoimmune diabetes in adults, sometimes called Type 1.5), and rarer monogenic forms. Each has its own characteristics, but Type 1 and Type 2 account for the vast majority of diagnoses.

## Why the distinction matters

Confusing Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes is not just an academic problem -- it has real consequences for the people living with these conditions.

**Safety.** Type 1 diabetes requires insulin to survive. There is no alternative. Advice that applies to Type 2 -- such as managing blood glucose through diet alone or delaying medication -- can be dangerous or fatal if applied to someone with Type 1. Equally, assuming that all people with Type 2 diabetes will eventually need insulin misrepresents a condition that many manage effectively without it.

**Stigma.** Type 2 diabetes is frequently framed as a "lifestyle disease," implying that the person is at fault. While modifiable risk factors play a role, genetics, age, ethnicity, and socioeconomic factors are also major contributors. Type 1 diabetes, meanwhile, is sometimes dismissed as a childhood condition or confused with Type 2 entirely, leading to misunderstanding from employers, schools, and even healthcare professionals.

**Misapplied advice.** Well-meaning guidance -- "just eat less sugar," "exercise more and you won't need medication" -- can be irrelevant to Type 1 and reductive for Type 2. Accurate understanding of which type someone has is the starting point for appropriate support.

## Common terms used across all types of diabetes

Several concepts come up in both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. The brief definitions below are intended to orient you; each topic is covered in more depth within the dedicated guides.

### Blood glucose testing

Blood glucose testing measures the concentration of glucose (sugar) in the blood at a given moment. It is a core part of diabetes self-management, used to inform decisions about food, activity, and medication. Testing methods include finger-prick capillary checks and continuous sensor-based monitoring.

Learn more in the [Type 1 Diabetes](/guides/type-1-diabetes/) and [Type 2 Diabetes](/guides/type-2-diabetes/) guides.

### HbA1c

HbA1c (glycated haemoglobin) is a blood test that reflects average blood glucose levels over the preceding two to three months. It is used both to diagnose diabetes and to monitor how well blood glucose is being managed over time. Unlike a single glucose reading, HbA1c provides a longer-term picture.

Learn more in the [Type 1 Diabetes](/guides/type-1-diabetes/) and [Type 2 Diabetes](/guides/type-2-diabetes/) guides.

### Hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia

Hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose) and hyperglycaemia (high blood glucose) are the two directions in which blood sugar can move outside a safe range. Hypoglycaemia is most commonly associated with insulin use and can cause immediate symptoms such as shakiness, confusion, and loss of consciousness. Hyperglycaemia develops when there is not enough insulin activity and, if sustained, contributes to long-term complications.

Learn more in the [Type 1 Diabetes](/guides/type-1-diabetes/) guide (where both are daily management concerns) and the [Type 2 Diabetes](/guides/type-2-diabetes/) guide.

### Insulin

Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that allows cells to take up glucose from the bloodstream. In Type 1 diabetes, insulin must be replaced externally because the body no longer produces it. In Type 2 diabetes, the body still produces insulin but either not enough or not effectively enough; external insulin may be added later in the course of the condition if other treatments are insufficient.

Learn more in the [Type 1 Diabetes](/guides/type-1-diabetes/) and [Type 2 Diabetes](/guides/type-2-diabetes/) guides.

### Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)

A continuous glucose monitor is a small wearable sensor that measures glucose levels in the interstitial fluid throughout the day and night, providing a near-real-time stream of data. CGMs reduce the need for routine finger-prick tests and can alert the wearer to rising or falling glucose trends before they become dangerous.

Learn more in the [Type 1 Diabetes](/guides/type-1-diabetes/) guide (where CGM use is most established) and the [Type 2 Diabetes](/guides/type-2-diabetes/) guide.
