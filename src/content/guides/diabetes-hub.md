# Diabetes Hub

Diabetes is a group of conditions where the body struggles to regulate blood sugar (glucose). Left untreated, diabetes can damage the heart, kidneys, nerves, eyes, and more. With proper management, people with diabetes can live full and healthy lives.

This hub brings together our guides on **Type 1 diabetes, Type 2 diabetes, and Prediabetes**, plus related resources on obesity, diet, and health monitoring.

## Key Points
- **Type 1 diabetes**: Autoimmune, requires insulin from diagnosis.  
- **Type 2 diabetes**: Linked to insulin resistance, lifestyle, and genetics.  
- **Prediabetes**: A warning stage that can often be reversed with lifestyle changes.  
- Rates of **type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents** are rising worldwide.  
- Good management reduces the risk of long-term complications.

## FAQ
**Q: Can diabetes be prevented?**  
A: Type 1 cannot be prevented. Type 2 can often be prevented or delayed with healthy weight, diet, and activity.  

**Q: Can diabetes be reversed?**  
A: Type 1 cannot. Some people with type 2 can return to normal blood sugar with sustained weight loss and lifestyle changes, but regular monitoring is still needed.  

**Q: What’s the difference between type 1 and type 2?**  
A: Type 1 is autoimmune and requires insulin from diagnosis. Type 2 develops gradually with insulin resistance and may be managed without insulin at first.  

**Q: What is prediabetes?**  
A: A state where blood sugar is above normal but not yet diabetes. It’s a warning stage that can often be reversed.  

**Q: Can children get type 2 diabetes?**  
A: Yes — rates are increasing, mainly due to obesity, poor diet, and inactivity.
