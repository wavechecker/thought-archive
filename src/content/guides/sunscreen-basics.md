# Sunscreen Basics

Sunscreen is one of the most effective tools to prevent skin cancer, sunburn, and premature aging. But not all sunscreens are equal — and not all claims are reliable.

**Summary**  
Choose a broad-spectrum SPF 30+ or higher, apply generously, and reapply often. Physical blockers like zinc are highly reliable, while chemical filters are also safe when tested properly.  

## What SPF Really Means
- **SPF 30** filters ~97% of UVB rays.  
- **SPF 50** filters ~98% of UVB rays.  
- No sunscreen blocks 100%.  
- The biggest factor is **application** — most people apply only half the recommended amount.  

## Types of Sunscreens
- **Chemical filters** (oxybenzone, avobenzone, octocrylene, etc.)  
  - *Pros*: Lighter feel, easier to spread, often invisible on skin.  
  - *Cons*: May irritate sensitive skin; some degrade faster in sun/heat.  

- **Physical/mineral blockers** (zinc oxide, titanium dioxide)  
  - *Pros*: Very stable, broad-spectrum, effective immediately, lower irritation risk.  
  - *Cons*: Thicker texture, can leave a white cast (though tinted formulas help).  

👉 **Zinc sunscreens** are often recommended by dermatologists, especially for sensitive skin and children, because their UV protection is consistent and reliable.  

## Which Sunscreens Can You Trust?
- Independent testing by **Choice (Australia)** and **Consumer Reports (US)** shows not all products match their label claims.  
- Zinc-based sunscreens generally perform well, including those marketed as "reef safe."  
- Some brands — like **Kokua Sun Care** (Hawaii, zinc-based, backed by pro surfer Kelly Slater) — build reputations on transparent testing.  

⚠️ Always look for **independent reviews and third-party testing**, not just the label.  

## Sunscreen and Coral Reefs
- **Myth**: Sunscreen causes coral bleaching.  
- **Truth**: Coral bleaching is primarily caused by **warming oceans from climate change**.  
- Some chemical UV filters (oxybenzone, octinoxate) may harm coral larvae in lab studies at high concentrations.  
- Real-world reef exposure is far lower, but many people choose **reef-safe (zinc-based)** sunscreens when swimming in sensitive areas.  

## How to Use Sunscreen Effectively
- Apply at least **a teaspoon per limb** (~30–40ml for full body).  
- Reapply every **2 hours**, or after swimming, sweating, or toweling off.  
- Use daily when the UV index is **3 or higher** (common in Australia year-round).  
- Combine with hats, clothing, and shade for full protection.  

## FAQs
**Q: Is zinc sunscreen better?**  
A: Zinc is stable, broad-spectrum, and very reliable. But high-quality chemical sunscreens are also safe and effective. The best sunscreen is the one you’ll actually use consistently.  

**Q: Do higher SPF sunscreens last longer?**  
A: No. SPF is about the level of protection, not duration. All sunscreens need reapplication.  

**Q: Can darker skin tones skip sunscreen?**  
A: No. While melanin provides some protection, darker skin can still develop sun damage, aging, and skin cancer.  

**Q: Can sunscreen prevent melanoma?**  
A: Yes. Regular daily use of SPF 30+ significantly lowers the risk of melanoma and other skin cancers.
