# Type 1 Diabetes — Guide Hub

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition where the body’s immune system attacks insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. Without insulin, the body cannot regulate blood sugar properly. It usually develops in childhood or adolescence but can occur at any age.

## Key Points
- Type 1 diabetes is **autoimmune** and not preventable.  
- People with type 1 require **insulin from diagnosis**.  
- Symptoms often appear suddenly: excessive thirst, urination, fatigue, weight loss.  
- Management requires **blood glucose monitoring, insulin therapy, healthy eating, and education**.  
- Complications can be avoided with good long-term management.

## FAQ
**Q: Can type 1 diabetes be prevented?**  
A: No. Unlike type 2, type 1 is an autoimmune condition and not linked to lifestyle.  

**Q: Do all children with diabetes have type 1?**  
A: No. Type 2 is increasingly seen in youth. See [Diabetes in Children and Adolescents](/guides/diabetes-children-adolescents).  

**Q: What’s the main difference between type 1 and type 2?**  
A: Type 1 requires insulin from diagnosis. Type 2 can sometimes be managed without insulin early on. See [Difference Between Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes](/guides/difference-between-type-1-and-type-2-diabetes).
