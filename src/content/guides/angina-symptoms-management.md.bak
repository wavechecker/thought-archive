## Intro
Angina is chest discomfort caused by reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. It is a warning sign of underlying heart disease and should never be ignored. Recognizing angina and managing it early can help prevent a heart attack.

## Key Points
- Angina = reduced blood flow to the heart muscle.
- Main types: **Stable**, **Unstable** (emergency), and **Variant (Prinzmetal’s)**.
- Symptoms include pressure, heaviness, pain radiating to arms/jaw, breathlessness.
- Management includes medication, lifestyle change, and urgent medical care for unstable angina.

## Background
Angina occurs when the heart’s demand for oxygen exceeds the supply delivered by narrowed or spasming coronary arteries. It does not permanently damage the heart muscle by itself, but it signals a high risk of heart attack and cardiovascular complications.

## Types of Angina
- **Stable Angina** — Predictable pattern, often triggered by exertion, stress, or heavy meals. Symptoms usually resolve with rest or medication.  
- **Unstable Angina** — More severe, occurs suddenly, and may happen at rest. This is a medical emergency that can precede a heart attack.  
- **Variant (Prinzmetal’s) Angina** — Caused by spasm of the coronary arteries, often at night or early morning. Less common.  

## Symptoms
- Chest pressure, heaviness, or squeezing sensation.
- Pain spreading to the shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back.
- Shortness of breath.
- Nausea, lightheadedness, or cold sweats.

## Management
- **Immediate relief:** Rest and use of prescribed medications such as nitroglycerin.  
- **Medical treatment:** Doctors may prescribe beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, statins, or antiplatelet medicines.  
- **Lifestyle changes:** Quit smoking, adopt a heart-healthy diet, manage stress, maintain healthy weight, and exercise as advised.  
- **Procedures:** Some people may need angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery.  
- **When to seek help:** Any sudden or worsening chest pain (unstable angina) requires emergency care.

## Risks & Outlook
Untreated angina increases the risk of heart attack and sudden cardiac death. With proper management—medications, lifestyle changes, and regular follow-up—many people live active lives.

## FAQ
**Q: When should I call emergency services?**  
A: If chest pain is new, worsening, or occurring at rest, call emergency services immediately — this could be unstable angina or a heart attack.  

**Q: Is angina the same as a heart attack?**  
A: No. Angina is temporary chest discomfort from reduced blood flow. A heart attack occurs when blood flow is completely blocked, causing permanent heart damage.
