## What this is (plain language)
Asthma makes airways swollen and twitchy. They can narrow and fill with mucus, causing cough, wheeze, and shortness of breath.

## Daily self-care (do this)
- Use preventer/controller inhaler as prescribed.
- Carry your reliever inhaler; check it isn’t empty.
- Know your triggers (smoke, dust, pollen, viral colds) and avoid them.
- Follow your written asthma action plan.
- Track symptoms or peak flow if asked by your clinician.

## Don’t do this
- Don’t rely only on reliever inhalers if symptoms are frequent.
- Don’t skip preventer doses when you feel well.

## Red-flag symptoms (urgent care)
- Severe breathlessness, blue lips, can’t speak full sentences.
- You need the reliever more often than every 3–4 hours.
- Peak flow <50% of your best.

## Inhaler tips (know the basics)
Check technique with a clinician or pharmacist. Many people breathe too fast or don’t shake the inhaler. Spacers often help.
