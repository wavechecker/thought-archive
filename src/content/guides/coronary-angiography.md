## Intro
Coronary angiography is a diagnostic test that uses dye and X-ray imaging to reveal blockages or narrowing in the heart’s blood vessels. It is one of the most common procedures to investigate chest pain, angina, or suspected heart disease.

## Key Points
- Shows real-time pictures of coronary arteries.  
- Helps diagnose and plan treatment for blockages.  
- Performed in a hospital catheterization (cath) lab.  
- Generally safe, but not without risks.  

## Background
The heart relies on coronary arteries to supply oxygen-rich blood. Narrowing or blockages from atherosclerosis can cause angina, heart attacks, or sudden cardiac death. Coronary angiography provides doctors with a map of these vessels to decide if medication, angioplasty (stents), or bypass surgery is needed.

## Why It’s Done
- To diagnose the cause of chest pain or unexplained shortness of breath.  
- To confirm suspected coronary artery disease seen on other tests (ECG, stress test, echocardiogram).  
- To plan treatment before angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery.  
- To evaluate complications after a heart attack.  

## The Procedure
- **Preparation:** You’ll be asked not to eat or drink for several hours; blood tests and consent are completed.  
- **Anaesthetic:** A local anaesthetic numbs the insertion site (wrist or groin).  
- **Catheter insertion:** A thin flexible tube is threaded through the artery to the coronary vessels.  
- **Contrast dye:** A special dye is injected to highlight the arteries.  
- **X-ray imaging:** Live fluoroscopy captures detailed images of blood flow.  

The test usually takes 30–60 minutes. Many patients go home the same day.

## After the Test
- Rest for several hours; keep the insertion site clean and dry.  
- Avoid heavy lifting for a few days.  
- Report swelling, bleeding, chest pain, or shortness of breath immediately.  
- Results are usually discussed before discharge or at follow-up.  

## Risks
Coronary angiography is generally safe but carries some risk:
- Bruising or bleeding at the insertion site.  
- Allergic reaction to contrast dye.  
- Irregular heart rhythms or chest pain.  
- Rarely, heart attack, stroke, or kidney damage.  

Your care team weighs these risks against the benefits of accurate diagnosis.

## FAQ
**Q: Is coronary angiography painful?**  
A: Most people only feel mild pressure during catheter insertion. The dye may cause a warm flushing sensation.  

**Q: How long is recovery?**  
A: Many patients resume light activities the next day; full recovery depends on whether additional treatment (stent, surgery) is performed.  

**Q: Is there an alternative test?**  
A: Yes. CT coronary angiography is less invasive, but standard catheter angiography provides more detailed and actionable results.
