Coronary angiography is a test that uses dye and X-rays to show the inside of your heart’s blood vessels.

**Why It’s Done:**
- Diagnose blockages in coronary arteries
- Plan for treatment (angioplasty, surgery)

**The Procedure:**
- Local anaesthetic
- Thin tube inserted into an artery
- Dye injected to show arteries on X-ray

**After the Test:**
- Rest and keep the insertion site clean
- Watch for swelling or bleeding
