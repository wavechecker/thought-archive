## Intro
Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition where the airways become inflamed and narrowed, making it hard to breathe. It affects people of all ages and often starts in childhood, though it can develop at any age.

## Key Points
- Asthma causes wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and breathlessness.  
- Symptoms often flare up in response to **triggers**.  
- Lung function tests (spirometry) confirm the diagnosis.  
- Inhalers are the mainstay of treatment.  
- Asthma cannot be cured, but it can be controlled.  

## Symptoms
- Wheezing (whistling sound on breathing)  
- Shortness of breath  
- Cough (worse at night or early morning)  
- Chest tightness  
- Fatigue during attacks  

## Common Triggers
- Allergens: dust mites, pollen, mold, pets  
- Respiratory infections (colds, flu)  
- Exercise, especially in cold air  
- Air pollution or cigarette smoke  
- Stress or strong emotions  

## Diagnosis
- **Medical history** and symptom diary  
- **Spirometry:** measures airflow obstruction and reversibility  
- **Peak flow monitoring:** tracks day-to-day variation  
- **Allergy testing** (sometimes)  

## Treatment
- **Reliever inhalers (bronchodilators):** quickly open the airways during attacks.  
- **Preventer inhalers (steroids):** reduce inflammation and prevent symptoms.  
- **Combination inhalers:** mix reliever + preventer for better control.  
- **Asthma action plan:** written plan for recognizing and managing flare-ups.  

## Risks and Prognosis
- Most people control asthma well with treatment.  
- Severe asthma increases risk of hospitalization and rare sudden attacks.  
- Long-term uncontrolled asthma can cause airway remodeling and reduced lung function.  

## FAQ
**Q: What is asthma?**  
A: A long-term inflammatory condition of the airways causing wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath.  

**Q: What triggers asthma attacks?**  
A: Allergens, infections, exercise, cold air, pollution, smoke, stress.  

**Q: How is asthma diagnosed?**  
A: Through symptom history and lung function tests like spirometry.  

**Q: How is asthma treated?**  
A: Inhalers (relievers and preventers), sometimes tablets, plus an action plan.  

**Q: Can asthma be cured?**  
A: No — but it can usually be controlled effectively.
