## Intro
Chest pain can range from mild discomfort to a crushing sensation that signals a heart attack. Because the stakes are high, it‚Äôs always safer to err on the side of caution.  

## Key Points
- **Call emergency services immediately** if chest pain is severe, sudden, or associated with breathlessness, fainting, or sweating.  
- Not all chest pain is from the heart ‚Äî lungs, stomach, and muscles can also be involved.  
- An ECG and blood tests are first-line hospital checks.  
- Younger adults, especially women, can have heart attacks from causes other than blocked arteries.  

## üö® Red Flags
- Sudden, severe, or crushing chest pain.  
- Pain radiating to the arm, jaw, neck, or back.  
- Associated shortness of breath, nausea, or fainting.  
- Blue lips or collapse ‚Äî call 911 immediately.  

## Background
Chest pain can arise from many sources:  
- **Heart-related:** heart attack, angina, pericarditis.  
- **Lung-related:** pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, pleurisy.  
- **Digestive:** reflux, gallbladder disease.  
- **Musculoskeletal:** costochondritis, strain.  
- **Other:** anxiety, panic attacks, shingles.  

## Diagnosis and Treatment
- **In the ER:** ECG, troponin blood tests, chest X-ray.  
- **Hospital care:** stents, medications, oxygen if needed.  
- **If non-cardiac:** treat underlying cause (antacids, antibiotics, rest).
