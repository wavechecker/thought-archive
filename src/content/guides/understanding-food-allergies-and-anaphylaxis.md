# Understanding Food Allergies and Anaphylaxis

Food allergies occur when the immune system overreacts to a food protein.  
**Anaphylaxis** is a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction. Even a tiny amount of allergen can trigger it in sensitive individuals.

## Common allergens

- Peanuts, tree nuts  
- Shellfish, fish  
- Milk, eggs  
- Wheat, soy  
- Sesame

## Symptoms

- Itching, hives, swelling of lips or face  
- Vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain  
- Wheezing, coughing, difficulty breathing  
- Dizziness, fainting, or collapse

## Anaphylaxis — act fast ⚠️

- Use **epinephrine auto-injector immediately**  
- Call **emergency services**
