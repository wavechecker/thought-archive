## Intro

Obesity is one of the most significant and visible drivers of poor metabolic health. Excess adiposity -- particularly visceral fat stored around the organs -- disrupts insulin signalling, raises blood pressure, alters blood lipids, and promotes chronic low-grade inflammation. These effects place obesity at the centre of cardiometabolic risk, linking it directly to Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and stroke.

This hub focuses on obesity as a condition: how it is measured, how fat distribution affects risk, and why metabolic syndrome matters as a clinical concept. For a broader view of metabolic health -- including GLP-1 medications, muscle preservation, and lifestyle foundations -- see the [Metabolic Health & Weight-Loss Medicines Hub](/guides/metabolic-health-hub/).

While BMI has long been the standard measure, newer research highlights the importance of **waist circumference, fat distribution, and metabolic syndrome** as stronger predictors of long-term outcomes. This hub brings together guides that explain the basics, how to measure your waist-to-hip ratio, and why metabolic syndrome matters.

## Why It Matters
Metabolic health isn’t only about weight. Waist size, fat distribution, and inflammatory markers tell a much richer story than BMI alone. By understanding these measures, patients and clinicians can better predict risk — and take action earlier.
