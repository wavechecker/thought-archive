## Intro
Obesity and metabolic health are closely linked to the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and stroke. While BMI has long been the standard measure, newer research highlights the importance of **waist circumference, fat distribution, and metabolic syndrome** as stronger predictors of long-term outcomes.  

This hub brings together guides that explain the basics, how to measure your waist-to-hip ratio, and why metabolic syndrome matters.

## Guides in This Hub
- [Obesity Basics](/guides/obesity-basics)  
- [Waist-to-Hip Ratio (WHR)](/guides/waist-to-hip-ratio)  
- [Metabolic Syndrome](/guides/metabolic-syndrome)  

## Why It Matters
Metabolic health isn’t only about weight. Waist size, fat distribution, and inflammatory markers tell a much richer story than BMI alone. By understanding these measures, patients and clinicians can better predict risk — and take action earlier.
