## Intro
Vaccines remain one of medicine’s most successful public-health tools.  
Yet even in 2025, misinformation still clouds public understanding — often louder than the science itself.  
This guide separates enduring vaccine myths from what research actually shows.

## Key Points
- Vaccines prevent 4–5 million deaths globally every year.  
- No credible evidence links vaccines to autism, infertility, or chronic illness.  
- “Too many, too soon” is a myth — the immune system safely handles thousands of antigens daily.  
- Combination vaccines (like MMR) are rigorously tested together for safety and efficacy.  
- Mild reactions (fever, soreness) are normal; severe reactions are extremely rare.

## Background
Vaccination introduces a harmless version of a pathogen to train the immune system.  
It builds protection without causing the disease itself.  

Before vaccines, diseases like polio, measles, and diphtheria killed or disabled millions each year.  
Routine childhood vaccination has eliminated or sharply reduced most of these threats — but complacency and misinformation have eroded confidence.

## Common Myths vs Facts

### Myth 1: Vaccines cause autism  
**Fact:** Multiple large-scale studies (over 1 million children) show no link between vaccines and autism.  
The 1998 study that sparked the claim was retracted for fraud and ethical violations.

### Myth 2: The immune system can be “overloaded”  
**Fact:** A baby’s immune system encounters thousands of microbes daily.  
The total antigen load from all current vaccines combined is far less than what the immune system manages naturally.

### Myth 3: Natural infection is better than vaccination  
**Fact:** Natural infection can cause severe complications, hospitalizations, and death.  
Vaccines provide similar or stronger immunity without those risks.

### Myth 4: Vaccines contain toxic levels of mercury or aluminum  
**Fact:** Modern vaccines no longer contain thimerosal (ethylmercury) in childhood formulations.  
Aluminum adjuvants are used in tiny, safe amounts — less than what’s ingested from food or water.

### Myth 5: MMR should be split into separate shots  
**Fact:** Combined vaccines reduce clinic visits, maintain high coverage, and show no safety difference compared to separate doses.

## Risks / Benefits / Prognosis
The risks of vaccination are extremely small compared to the diseases they prevent.  
Outbreaks — like the ongoing 2025 U.S. measles resurgence — show what happens when immunization gaps widen.  
High community coverage protects everyone, especially infants and immunocompromised people.

## FAQ
**Q: Are vaccines safe for pregnant women?**  
A: Yes — certain vaccines (e.g., influenza, Tdap, COVID-19) are recommended during pregnancy to protect both mother and newborn.  

**Q: Can vaccinated people still get sick?**  
A: Occasionally, yes — but infections are typically much milder.  

**Q: Do vaccines cause autoimmune diseases?**  
A: No evidence supports that claim; large cohort studies show no increased risk.  

**Q: Why do some people react badly?**  
A: Rare allergic reactions can occur, usually due to specific ingredients like gelatin or yeast — not the active vaccine component.
