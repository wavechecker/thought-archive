Pulse oximeters estimate oxygen saturation (**SpO₂**) using light sensors on your finger.

## Summary
Normal SpO₂ is usually **95–100%** at sea level. Readings **≤92% at rest** or a **sudden drop** from your baseline warrant clinical advice—especially with shortness of breath or chest pain.

## Normal values and limits
- **Healthy adults (sea level):** typically **95–100%**  
- **Concerning:** **<92–93%** at rest (context matters; follow your plan)  
- Chronic lung disease or altitude may lower “normal” (follow clinician guidance)

## How to measure accurately
- Warm hands; remove nail polish/false nails  
- Rest 5 minutes; sit still and **don’t talk**  
- Keep the probe steady until the reading stabilizes  
- If numbers jump, take several readings and average

## When to seek care
- **SpO₂ ≤ 92%** at rest, or a **sudden drop** from your usual baseline  
- Low readings with **shortness of breath, chest pain, confusion, or blue lips**

## Common pitfalls
- Poor circulation = unreliable readings  
- Motion, cold fingers, dark polish, or strong ambient light can skew results
