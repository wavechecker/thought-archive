## Intro
Exercise is one of the best tools for improving **glucose control, cardiovascular health, mood, and sleep**.  
With type 1 diabetes (T1D), the main challenge is **avoiding hypoglycaemia** during and after activity while still gaining the benefits.  
With planning and monitoring, most people with T1D can safely enjoy any sport.

---

## Key Points
- **Aerobic activity** (steady cardio) usually **lowers glucose** during and after.  
- **Anaerobic/high-intensity or strength** may cause a **temporary rise**, sometimes followed by a later drop.  
- Always **check glucose before exercise** and keep **fast carbs within reach**.  
- Use **CGM trend arrows** to act early.  
- Watch for **late-onset hypos** (up to 24h after prolonged or evening sessions).  

---

## Pre-Exercise Checklist
- ✅ Check glucose (and **CGM trend** if available).  
- ✅ Carry **15–30 g fast carbs** (glucose tabs/gel/juice).  
- ✅ Hydrate well.  
- ✅ Wear **medical ID** indicating T1D.  
- ✅ Don’t exercise alone if prone to severe hypos.  
- ✅ Check infusion sites/sensors — avoid pressure or direct hits.

## Quick Decision Table — Starting Glucose

| Starting glucose | Action |
|------------------|--------|
| **<5.6 mmol/L (<100 mg/dL)** | Take **15–20 g fast carbs**, recheck in 15 min. Delay exercise until ≥5.6. |
| **5.6–10 mmol/L (100–180 mg/dL)** | Safe range. For aerobic: reduce pre-meal bolus (–25–50%) or temp basal (–20–50%). Take **10–20 g carbs** at start if needed. |
| **>10–13.9 mmol/L (180–250 mg/dL)** | Usually safe to start. Monitor closely; correction may not be needed before exercise. |
| **>13.9 mmol/L (>250 mg/dL)** | Check ketones. If positive → **do not exercise**; give correction and hydrate. If negative → light activity only until trending down. |

---

## During Exercise
- Recheck every **30 minutes** (or track CGM).  
- Take **10–20 g carbs** if dropping or if symptoms suggest a low.  
- Mix **fast carbs** (for quick rescue) with **slower carbs** (banana, bar) for long sessions.  
- ⚠️ Remember: hypo symptoms can mimic normal exercise fatigue → **check, don’t guess**.  

---

## After Exercise (and Overnight)
- Risk of **delayed hypos** is highest after:  
  - Long aerobic sessions  
  - Evening workouts  
  - Unfamiliar/new activities  
- Consider:  
  - **Temp basal reduction** (pump: –10% to –30% for 6–12h).  
  - **Bedtime snack** with carb + protein if trending low.  
  - Raising CGM **low alerts** overnight on training days.  
- Monitor more closely for **up to 24 hours** after prolonged sessions.  

---

## Site Management
- Rotate infusion and sensor sites.  
- Avoid sites that take **direct impact or heavy friction**.  
- For swimmers/sweaty sports: use overpatches/extra adhesive.  
- Plan **site changes before competitions**, not during.  

---

## Sick Days & Heat
- Illness and heat can raise glucose and **increase insulin needs**.  
- Monitor more often; adjust with clinical guidance.  

---

## Red Flags — Seek Medical Advice
- Repeated severe hypos needing assistance.  
- Ketones that don’t resolve with correction and fluids.  
- Unexplained persistent highs during/after light activity.  
- ⚠️ Any loss of consciousness during activity → review safety plan with your team before resuming.  

---

## FAQ
**Do I need different targets for competition days?**  
Yes, some athletes run slightly higher targets to reduce hypo risk — discuss with your team.  

**Are sports drinks okay?**  
Yes, during long or high-intensity sessions. Otherwise, stick to water and planned carbs.  

**Pump vs. injections for sport?**  
Pumps allow **temp basal adjustments**. With MDI, pre-planning bolus reductions and timed carbs also works well.
