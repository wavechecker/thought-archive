Exercise is great for health, but it can affect blood sugar in unpredictable ways. Planning is key.

**Before Exercise:**
- Check blood sugar
- Have a snack if levels are on the lower side

**During Exercise:**
- Monitor for symptoms of hypoglycaemia
- Keep glucose tabs or gel handy

**After Exercise:**
- Blood sugars can drop for hours afterwards
- Monitor more frequently and adjust insulin if needed
