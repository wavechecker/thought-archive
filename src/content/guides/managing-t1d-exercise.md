## Intro
Exercise is great for glucose control, heart health, mood, and sleep. With type 1 diabetes (T1D), the main challenge is **avoiding hypoglycemia** during and after activity while still getting the benefits of training.

## Key Points
- **Aerobic activity** (steady cardio) tends to **lower glucose** during/after.
- **Anaerobic/high-intensity or strength** can **raise** glucose short-term, then sometimes drop later.
- Plan ahead: **check glucose**, **adjust insulin**, and **carry fast carbs**.
- Watch for **late-onset hypos** (up to 24 hours after long or intense sessions).

## Pre-Exercise Checklist
- Check glucose (and **trend** if using CGM).
- Have **15–30 g fast carbs** handy (glucose tabs/gel/juice).
- Consider location of infusion sites/sensors—avoid pressure or direct hits.
- Hydrate well; wear ID indicating T1D.

## Insulin & Carb Strategies (general principles)
> Always follow your clinician’s advice; individual responses vary.

**If starting in target (≈5.6–10 mmol/L / 100–180 mg/dL):**
- **Aerobic 30–60 min:** reduce rapid-acting bolus **1–2 hours before** by ~25–50% *or* take **10–20 g carbs** at start; consider pump temp basal **–20% to –50%** starting 60–90 min before.
- **>60 min aerobic:** plan **10–20 g carbs every 20–30 min**; larger basal reductions may be needed.
- **Intervals/strength:** may not need extra carbs up front; monitor for a later drop and correct if needed.

**If starting low (<5.6 mmol/L / <100 mg/dL):**
- Take **15–20 g fast carbs**, recheck in 15 minutes; delay exercise until ≥5.6 mmol/L (≥100 mg/dL).

**If starting high (>13.9 mmol/L / >250 mg/dL):**
- Check for **ketones**. If positive, **defer exercise** and correct. If no ketones, light activity may be okay; avoid vigorous work until trending down.

## During Exercise
- Recheck every **30 minutes** (or watch CGM trend arrows).
- Take **10–20 g carbs** if dropping or symptomatic.
- For long sessions, mix fast carbs (to treat drops) with **slower carbs** (bars/banana) to sustain.

## After Exercise (and Overnight)
- Risk of delayed hypos is highest after long aerobic work or evening training.
- Consider **reduced basal** (pump temp basal –10% to –30% for 6–12 h) or a **bedtime snack** with some protein/slow carbs if you trend low.
- Set CGM **alerts** a bit higher overnight on hard-training days.

## Site Management
- Rotate infusion and sensor sites; avoid spots that get friction or heavy impact.
- For swimmers/sweaty sports, use extra adhesive/overpatches.

## Sick Days & Heat
- Illness and heat can **raise** insulin needs; monitor more often and adjust with guidance.

## Red Flags — Seek Medical Advice
- Repeated severe hypos needing assistance.
- Ketones that don’t clear with correction/fluids.
- Unexplained high glucose during/after light activity.

## FAQ
**Do I need different targets for competition days?**  
Some athletes run slightly **higher targets** to reduce hypo risk—discuss a plan with your team.

**Are sports drinks okay?**  
They can help **during** long intense sessions; otherwise prefer water and targeted carbs.

**Pump vs. injections for sport?**  
Pumps allow **temp basal** tweaks; MDI can work well with planned bolus reductions and timed carbs.
