## Intro
Illness (fever, vomiting, infections) raises stress hormones that push glucose up and increase ketone risk. **Never stop insulin** on sick days—dose adjustments, more frequent checks, and fluids keep you safe.

## Key Points
- **Keep taking basal insulin** (pump or long-acting) even if not eating.
- Check **glucose and ketones** more often (see schedule below).
- **Fluids every hour**; add salts if vomiting/diarrhoea.
- **Seek urgent care** with high ketones, vomiting, or signs of DKA.

## Sick-Day Testing Schedule
- **Glucose:** every **2–4 h** (hourly if rising fast).
- **Ketones (blood preferred):**
  - If glucose **>13.9 mmol/L (250 mg/dL)** or you feel unwell → **check now**.
  - Re-check **every 1–2 h** until normal.

## Ketone Actions (general framework — follow your clinic plan)
| Blood ketones | What to do |
|---|---|
| **0.6–1.4 mmol/L** | Extra **fluids**; **correction insulin** per plan; recheck in **1–2 h**. |
| **1.5–2.9 mmol/L** | **Fluids**, **extra insulin** (often 10–20% of total daily dose or ~0.1 u/kg*); recheck **hourly**. |
| **≥3.0 mmol/L** or any vomiting/abdominal pain/drowsiness | **Emergency department now.** Start fluids and follow correction advice **en route**. |

\*Use your personalized sick-day rules; doses vary by clinic and individual.

## Insulin Adjustments
- **Pumps:** check for site/tubing failure first; change set if in doubt. Consider temporary **higher basal** if persistently high without ketones (per plan).
- **MDI:** continue long-acting; use **correction rapid-acting** according to your sensitivity factor. If not eating, you still need basal and may need small correction boluses.

## Hydration & Food
- Aim for **250–500 ml** fluids hourly. Use electrolyte solutions if vomiting/diarrhoea.
- If unable to eat solids, try **carb liquids** (juice, oral rehydration) in small sips to match insulin needs.
- If you **cannot keep fluids down** → **urgent care**.

## When to Seek Urgent Care
- **Ketones ≥3.0 mmol/L**, or **moderate/large urine ketones**.
- **Persistent vomiting**, severe abdominal pain, **deep/fast breathing**, confusion, or extreme drowsiness.
- Child, pregnancy, or significant co-illness → **lower threshold** for ED.

## Medications & Extras
- Avoid NSAIDs if dehydrated unless advised.
- Some cold meds contain sugar/stimulants—check labels.
- Keep **backup pens/syringes** even if you use a pump.

## FAQ
**Should I stop insulin if I’m not eating?**  
No. Keep **basal** going and use small corrections as needed.

**Can I exercise to bring glucose down?**  
Not with **positive ketones**—exercise can worsen DKA risk.

**What if ketone strips aren’t available?**  
Treat as higher risk: hydrate, give correction insulin per plan, and seek medical advice sooner.
