# Type 1 Diabetes ‚Äî Sick-Day Management

Illness (fever, vomiting, infections) raises stress hormones that push glucose up and increase ketone risk. **Never stop insulin** on sick days ‚Äî careful adjustments, more frequent checks, and hydration keep you safe.  

---

## üöë Bottom Line
- **Keep taking basal insulin** (pump or long-acting), even if not eating.  
- **Check glucose + ketones frequently** (every 2‚Äì4 hours; hourly if unwell or glucose rising).  
- **Seek urgent care** with ketones ‚â•3.0 mmol/L, vomiting, abdominal pain, drowsiness, or rapid breathing.  

---

## Sick-Day Testing Schedule
- **Glucose:** every **2‚Äì4 hours** (hourly if rising fast).  
- **Ketones (blood preferred):**  
  - If glucose **>13.9 mmol/L (250 mg/dL)** or if you feel unwell ‚Üí **check now**.  
  - Re-check **every 1‚Äì2 hours** until back to normal.

## Ketone Actions (general framework ‚Äî follow your clinic plan)

| Blood ketones | What to do |
|---|---|
| **0.6‚Äì1.4 mmol/L** | Extra **fluids**; **correction insulin** per plan; recheck in 1‚Äì2 h. |
| **1.5‚Äì2.9 mmol/L** | **Fluids**, **extra insulin** (often 10‚Äì20% of total daily dose or ~0.1 u/kg*); recheck hourly. |
| **‚â•3.0 mmol/L** or any vomiting/abdominal pain/drowsiness | ‚ö†Ô∏è **Emergency department now.** Start fluids and correction insulin en route. |

\*Use your personalised sick-day rules; doses vary by clinic and individual.

---

## Insulin Adjustments
- **Pump users:** check for site/tubing failure first; change set if in doubt. Consider a temporary **higher basal rate** if persistently high without ketones.  
- **MDI (multiple daily injections):** continue long-acting; give **correction rapid-acting** as needed. Even if not eating, you must take basal and small corrections.  

---

## Hydration & Food
- Aim for **250‚Äì500 ml** fluids hourly.  
- Use electrolyte drinks if vomiting/diarrhoea.  
- If unable to eat solids: take **carb-containing liquids** (juice, ORS, broth) in small sips to match insulin.  
- If you **cannot keep fluids down** ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è **urgent medical care required**.  

---

## When to Seek Urgent Care
- **Ketones ‚â•3.0 mmol/L**, or moderate/large urine ketones.  
- **Persistent vomiting**, severe abdominal pain.  
- **Rapid breathing, fruity-smelling breath, confusion, extreme drowsiness.**  
- Children, pregnancy, or other co-illness ‚Üí **lower threshold** for ED.  

---

## Medications & Extras
- Avoid NSAIDs if dehydrated unless prescribed.  
- Check cold/flu meds ‚Äî some contain sugar or stimulants.  
- Keep **backup pens/syringes** in case of pump failure.  

---

## FAQ
**Should I stop insulin if I‚Äôm not eating?**  
No. Always continue basal insulin; use corrections as needed.  

**Can I exercise to bring glucose down?**  
Not with **positive ketones** ‚Äî this can worsen DKA.  

**What if ketone strips aren‚Äôt available?**  
Act cautiously: hydrate, give correction insulin per plan, and seek medical advice sooner.
