## Summary

Alzheimer’s disease is a neurodegenerative condition and the most common cause of dementia. It affects memory, thinking, and daily function over time.

This guide covers:
- what Alzheimer’s is (and what it isn’t)
- common symptoms and progression
- how diagnosis is made
- the role of biomarkers (amyloid, tau, blood tests)
- treatment options and practical planning

## What is Alzheimer’s disease?

Alzheimer’s disease is associated with abnormal brain protein pathology (commonly described as **amyloid plaques** and **tau tangles**) alongside progressive neurodegeneration. Symptoms usually develop gradually and worsen over years.

## Symptoms

Typical early symptoms include:
- short-term memory problems
- difficulty finding words
- getting lost in familiar places
- changes in executive function (planning, organization)

As the disease progresses, symptoms can include:
- loss of independence in daily tasks
- behavioral or personality changes
- language and visuospatial problems

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis commonly involves:
- clinical history (including collateral history from family)
- cognitive assessment
- neurological examination
- blood tests to rule out other causes
- brain imaging when needed
- biomarker testing in selected settings

## Biomarkers and staging

Modern frameworks describe Alzheimer’s as a clinical-biological condition:
- **Biomarkers** can indicate the presence of Alzheimer’s pathology.
- **Symptoms and function** determine clinical stage and day-to-day impact.

Blood-based biomarkers are increasingly used to support diagnostic workups in appropriate clinical contexts.

## Treatment and management (current reality)

Management typically includes:
- symptom-focused medications when appropriate
- risk reduction and comorbidity management
- practical supports and planning (safety, driving, finances)
- caregiver support

In some settings, disease-modifying therapies for early Alzheimer’s may be available, with eligibility determined by clinical stage and biomarker evidence.

## FAQ

### Is Alzheimer’s disease the same as dementia?

No. Dementia is a syndrome (a set of symptoms). Alzheimer’s disease is a specific disease and a common cause of dementia.

### Can a blood test diagnose Alzheimer’s disease?

Blood biomarkers can support diagnosis in appropriate clinical contexts, but interpretation depends on symptoms, age, and the broader clinical picture.

### Do biomarkers predict exactly when symptoms will start?

Not exactly. Some research models can estimate symptom onset windows, but prediction uncertainty is still too large for exact forecasting in individuals.
