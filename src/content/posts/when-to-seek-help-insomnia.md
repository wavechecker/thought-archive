## Hook
Everyone has the occasional rough night. But when you’ve been staring at the ceiling for months, it’s not just “bad sleep” — it’s insomnia. And waiting it out won’t fix it.

## Context
Insomnia is one of the most common sleep disorders. Yet many people put off seeking help, hoping it will resolve on its own. The truth: when insomnia lasts beyond a few weeks and starts interfering with your life, self-help isn’t enough. That’s when medical evaluation and CBT-I come into play.

## Your Take
Here’s the simple rule of thumb:  
- **3 nights a week. 3 months. Trouble functioning.**  
That’s the point when insomnia crosses from normal stress-related sleeplessness into something that needs professional support.  

Sleeping pills may provide short-term relief, but CBT-I — cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia — is the treatment that fixes the underlying cycle.

## Implications
Left untreated, chronic insomnia increases your risk for depression, accidents, and heart disease. Getting help early isn’t just about better nights — it’s about protecting your long-term health.

## Closing
If insomnia has been your “new normal” for months, stop waiting it out. The best time to seek help is now.
