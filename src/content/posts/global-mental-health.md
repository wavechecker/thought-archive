## Intro
In September 2025, the World Health Organization (WHO) released two major reports—*World Mental Health Today 2025* and the *Mental Health Atlas 2024*. Together, they highlight a pressing reality: more than **1 billion people worldwide** are living with mental health conditions, yet most still do not receive adequate care. Mental health disorders are now the **second leading cause of years lived with disability** globally.

## Key Points
- Over **1 billion people** live with mental health conditions.  
- Mental disorders are the **second leading cause of disability worldwide**.  
- Annual productivity losses from depression and anxiety exceed **US $1 trillion**.  
- Fewer than **10%** of affected people in low-income countries receive treatment.  
- Governments spend, on average, only **2% of health budgets** on mental health.  
- There are just **13 mental health workers per 100,000 people** worldwide (only 2 in low-income countries, 60+ in high-income).  
- Suicide remains a leading cause of death among young people (third among ages 15–29).

## Causes or Mechanisms
- **Biological factors:** genetics, brain chemistry, chronic illness.  
- **Psychological factors:** trauma, stress, adverse childhood experiences.  
- **Social determinants:** poverty, inequality, conflict, and displacement.

## Diagnosis / Treatment / Options
- **Early detection:** screening in schools, workplaces, and primary care settings.  
- **Treatment:** therapy (CBT, counseling), medications, community-based programs.  
- **Innovations:** telepsychiatry and digital platforms can extend reach, especially in low-resource settings.  
- **System reforms:** WHO recommends integrating mental health into **primary health care**, scaling up workforce training, and increasing national budget allocations.

## Risks / Benefits / Prognosis
- **Untreated risks:** disability, suicide, reduced life expectancy, economic loss.  
- **Benefits of treatment:** improved quality of life, reduced healthcare costs, restored productivity.  
- **Prognosis:** With adequate treatment, many mental health conditions are highly manageable; early intervention improves outcomes significantly.
