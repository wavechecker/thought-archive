## Hook
**1,500 + measles cases** in the U.S. this year — the most in decades.  
So why are some voices flirting with rolling back routine MMR?  
That’s not prudence. That’s negligence dressed up as debate.

## Context
- **The surge:** CDC reports > 1,500 confirmed cases in 2025, seeded by under-vaccinated communities.  
- **The spark:** Kindergarten MMR coverage ≈ 92–93 %, below the 95 % needed for herd protection.  
- **Policy noise:** ACIP’s MMRV tweak for < age 4 is a safety optimization, not a rollback of MMR.

<Aside title="The boring fix that works" variant="success">
Restore **≥ 95 %** two-dose coverage, catch-up MMR, and communicate clearly.  
Outbreaks follow **under-vaccination**, not vaccine failure.
</Aside>

## Your Take
Rolling back MMR mid-outbreak is like removing seatbelts because traffic’s heavy.  
Measles is airborne, ferociously contagious, and fast.  
It hits babies too young for MMR and those who can’t be vaccinated.

## What Responsible Policy Looks Like
1. **Protect the vulnerable:** Maintain ≥ 95 % MMR.  
2. **Catch up now:** Extra doses are safe.  
3. **Clarify MMRV decision:** About seizure risk reduction, not vaccine downgrade.  
4. **Travel check:** Verify two doses before international travel.

## Implications
Normalize delay, and you normalize disease.  
The way out is boring but sure: vaccinate, document, close gaps.

## Closing
We don’t fight fires by arguing about the hose.  
**Get MMR done — and keep it that way.**
