## Hook
More than **1,500 measles cases** in the U.S. this year—the most in decades. Hospitals have treated clusters across dozens of states. So why are some voices flirting with rolling back routine MMR? That’s not prudence. That’s negligence, dressed up as debate.

## Context
- **The surge:** CDC updates have crossed **1,500+ confirmed cases** in 2025, with clusters seeded by under-vaccinated communities.
- **The spark:** Kindergarten MMR coverage has sagged to ~**92–93%**, below the **~95%** herd-protection threshold.
- **Policy noise:** ACIP’s recent tweak **reduces MMRV use under age 4** (favor separate MMR + varicella). That’s a safety optimization—not a retreat from MMR.

<Aside title="The boring fix that works" variant="success">
Restore **≥95%** two-dose coverage, do catch-up MMR, and message clearly. Outbreaks track with **under-vaccination**, not with vaccine failure.
</Aside>

## Your Take
Rolling back MMR in the middle of an active outbreak is like removing seatbelts because traffic is heavy. Measles is airborne, fantastically contagious, and fast. The burden lands on babies too young for MMR and on the immunocompromised who can’t be vaccinated.

## What Responsible Policy Looks Like
1. **Protect the vulnerable:** Keep communities at or above **95% MMR**.
2. **Catch up now:** If records are unclear, vaccinate—extra doses are safe.
3. **Clarify the MMRV decision:** It’s about minimizing febrile seizures in toddlers, not down-ranking measles vaccination.
4. **Travel reality check:** Verify two doses **before** international travel; importations still seed outbreaks.

## Implications
Normalize “delay” and you normalize disease. The fastest way to end outbreaks is the most boring: vaccinate, document, close gaps.

## Closing
We don’t fight fires by arguing about the hose. **Get MMR done.** Then keep it that way.
