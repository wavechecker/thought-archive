## Hook
We talk about depression as if the brain simply “goes wrong.”  
But what if a huge slice of modern mental illness is actually the mind trying to run on **metabolic fumes**?

## Context
Rates of anxiety, depression, burnout, and cognitive fatigue keep rising.  
So do obesity, insulin resistance, sleep deprivation, and chronic stress.

These epidemics are treated separately — different clinics, different treatments, different specialists — but biologically they are **the same story told in different organs**.

Yet we continue to treat mental health as if the brain floats in a sterile jar, untouched by metabolism, sleep, food, inflammation, or hormones.

It’s a 20th-century model being applied to a 21st-century physiology.

## Your Take
Here’s the uncomfortable truth:

> **A stressed, inflamed, sleep-deprived, insulin-resistant body cannot produce a stable mind.**

That doesn’t mean mental illness is “all physical.”  
But it does mean that a huge portion of emotional suffering is **biological load disguised as psychological despair**.

We medicalise the symptoms but ignore the system.

We tell people with depression:
- “Try mindfulness”
- “Do gratitude journaling”
- “Get therapy”
- “Go for a walk”

These aren’t wrong.  
They’re just **incomplete**.

Because if the foundation is metabolically unstable —  
if sleep is fragmented, if insulin is spiking, if inflammation is simmering, if stress is chronic, if alcohol is high — then the brain simply **cannot regulate mood normally**.

Psychological tools can’t overcome physiological chaos.

And then the loop kicks in:
