## Hook
We treat depression like the brain has malfunctioned.  
But what if a huge part of modern mental suffering is simply the mind trying to run on **metabolic fumes**?

## Context
Anxiety, burnout, fatigue, and cognitive fog are rising.  
So are obesity, insulin resistance, alcohol intake, sleep disruption, and chronic stress.

These aren’t separate epidemics.  
They’re **the same biological slowdown**, expressed in different systems.

Yet mental healthcare still acts as if the brain floats in isolation — untouched by sleep, glucose, inflammation, or hormones.

It’s a 20th-century model being applied to a 21st-century physiology.

## Your Take
Here’s the uncomfortable truth:

> **A stressed, inflamed, sleep-deprived, insulin-resistant body cannot produce a stable, resilient mind.**

This doesn’t make depression “all physical.”  
It means psychology and physiology are not competing explanations — they’re **interlocked systems**.

We encourage therapy, journaling, mindfulness, and cognitive tools — all useful.  
But these operate **on top of** a biological foundation.

If that foundation is unstable —  
- disrupted sleep  
- smoking or alcohol load  
- insulin resistance  
- chronic inflammation  
- blood sugar volatility  
- high visceral fat  
— then the brain is essentially running on noisy, unstable inputs.

Therapy can’t override physiology that’s actively working against you.

And then the loop forms:

  A[Low mood, fatigue, anxiety, brain fog] --> B[Less movement]
  B --> C[Worse sleep: fragmentation, late nights]
  C --> D[Worse metabolism: insulin resistance, visceral fat]
  D --> E[More inflammation and hormonal disruption]
  E --> A
