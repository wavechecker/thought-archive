## Hook
Over the last eight years, overdose deaths involving fentanyl *and* other substances in older adults have **skyrocketed** — yet most coverage still treats overdose risk as a younger-person issue.

## Context
- A recent study presented at the American Society of Anesthesiologists’ annual meeting found that among adults aged **65 and older**, deaths involving fentanyl + stimulants rose nearly **9,000%** between 2015 and 2023.  
- Fentanyl-related deaths in this age group climbed from **264 in 2015** to **4,144 in 2023** — a ~1,470% increase.  
- CDC data show older adults 65+ had the **largest percent increase** in drug-overdose death rates of any age group from 2021 → 2022 (12.0 → 13.2 deaths per 100k).  
- In older adults, overdoses are often **multi-substance events**, not isolated fentanyl ingestion.  
- Alcohol co-use with synthetic opioids is rising — from 9 % in 2010 to 17 % in 2019 in Texas toxicology reports.

## Your Take
This is a **vital warning** moment: older adults are no longer outside the opioid-crisis zone.  
Historically, we viewed them as lower-risk — but the numbers say otherwise.

Key factors:
- **Metabolism slows with age**, increasing drug half-life and toxicity.  
- **Polypharmacy** (multiple prescriptions) and alcohol use magnify respiratory depression risk.  
- Many older users are **unaware of fentanyl contamination** in counterfeit pills or cocaine.  
- **Stigma and invisibility** mean prevention efforts rarely target seniors.

## Implications
- **Clinicians:** screen for substance use and alcohol co-use in older adults, not just younger populations.  
- **Families:** watch for overlapping sedative use and subtle warning signs (fatigue, confusion, falls).  
- **Public health:** include older adults in harm-reduction messaging and naloxone training.  
- **Community:** ensure access to naloxone and open, stigma-free conversations around pain, aging, and substance use.

## What’s Missing
- Limited data on **fentanyl + alcohol** deaths specifically in older adults.  
- Unknown motivations: recreational? self-medication? unintentional contamination?  
- Few **geriatric-specific treatment programs** that address cognitive decline, mobility, and isolation.  

## Why It Matters
The assumption that “opioid overdoses are a young-person issue” is now dangerously outdated.  
As global populations age, the burden of **poly-substance deaths** among older adults will grow — affecting families, hospitals, and social systems.

## FAQ
**Q: Is this from prescription fentanyl?**  
A: Mostly not — illicitly manufactured fentanyl mixed into street drugs is the main driver.  

**Q: Why are older adults especially at risk?**  
A: Slower metabolism, multiple medications, and higher rates of chronic illness amplify overdose risk.  

**Q: Is alcohol part of the picture?**  
A: Yes — combining alcohol with opioids increases respiratory depression and overdose likelihood.  

**Q: What can families do?**  
A: Keep naloxone nearby, discuss all medications and supplements, and learn the signs of overdose.  

**Q: What does an overdose look like?**  
A: Slow or stopped breathing, pinpoint pupils, blue lips, unresponsiveness. Call emergency services and administer naloxone immediately.

## Closing
Older adults are quietly becoming a new front line of the fentanyl crisis.  
Recognizing the signs, reducing stigma, and broadening harm-reduction outreach could save thousands of lives.
