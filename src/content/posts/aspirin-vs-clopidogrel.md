# The End of Aspirin’s Reign?

## Intro  
For decades, low-dose aspirin has been medicine’s cheap, default weapon against heart attacks and strokes. But a new analysis — seven clinical trials, nearly **29,000 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD)** — may have just dethroned it.  

## Context  
The study, presented at the European Society of Cardiology congress and published in *The Lancet*, pooled results from diverse patient groups worldwide. The verdict: **clopidogrel was superior to aspirin at preventing heart attacks, strokes, and cardiovascular death, without increasing bleeding risk.**  

This isn’t a boutique finding. Even patients who respond less well to clopidogrel for genetic reasons still did better than those on aspirin.  

## My Take  
Medicine changes slowly — not because the data aren’t there, but because cost, access, and inertia keep old practices alive. Aspirin was cheap, over-the-counter, and entrenched. Clopidogrel used to be expensive and locked behind prescriptions.  

Now it’s generic, affordable, and backed by nearly 30,000 patients. **If clopidogrel is safer for the stomach, just as safe for bleeding, and more effective at preventing events, why is aspirin still king?**  

## Implications  
- Doctors may begin prescribing clopidogrel as the *first-line pill* for CAD.  
- Guidelines could shift worldwide.  
- Aspirin won’t disappear overnight, but its era as the “default” heart protector may be ending.  

## Costs & Access  
For years, aspirin stayed king because it was cheap and over-the-counter, while clopidogrel was expensive and brand-only. That changed in 2012, when clopidogrel went generic.  

- **Aspirin**: still the cheapest — pennies per pill.  
- **Clopidogrel**: now just a few dollars per month in most countries, often covered by insurance or national health systems.  

This shift matters because the old “cost barrier” no longer applies. And since clopidogrel is off-patent, there’s no major profit grab by big pharma — the market is full of generics. The real driver now is whether guidelines catch up with the evidence.

## FAQ  
**Q: Is clopidogrel safer than aspirin?**  
A: Clopidogrel has a similar risk of bleeding but causes fewer stomach issues. Aspirin is more likely to irritate the stomach and cause ulcers or GI bleeds.  

**Q: Should patients switch now?**  
A: Not without medical advice. Guidelines haven’t yet changed, but many cardiologists will be rethinking their default prescriptions.  

**Q: How strong is the evidence?**  
A: Seven randomized trials, nearly 29,000 patients — enough to move the needle on global guidelines.

## Closing  
Sometimes medicine doesn’t advance with new inventions. It advances when we admit the old standbys aren’t the best we can do.
