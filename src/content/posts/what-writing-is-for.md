Most people writing online want attention, revenue, or status.  
I want truth, clarity, release.

One leads to content.  
The other leads to something worth reading.

We used to write because we had something to say.  
Now people write because they have something to sell - or worse, something to signal.

Instagram and OnlyFans made it about grabbing eyeballs.  
Twitter (or X, if you're still pretending it matters) made it about quips and clout.  
Facebook became a curated resume for people who want you to know how well they're doing - or how broken they are, depending on what plays better that week.

**Reddit?**  
Once a portal to the bleeding edge - of tech, culture, the internet itself.  
Now it's just an echo chamber, full of manufactured consensus and stale talking points in upvote form.

I fled Twitter after the renaming.  
It felt base. Like someone had spray-painted a dollar sign over a city wall and called it vision.  
(But hey Elon, if you bought it, I guess you can do whatever you want with it.)

**And TikTok?**  
I wouldn't trust the Chinese government with anything of mine.  
At least capitalists only want your money.  
These days, even that feels quaint.  
Now they want your face, your age, your behavior, your patterns, your biometric data.

We've already reached the point where just performing a search might require an age check.  
Facial recognition, ID verification, biometric gating - surveillance baked into convenience.

What began as freedom is becoming a velvet cage.

It's like war by software.  
It slips in - unobtrusively at first - and then your freedoms begin to vanish.  
Not with tanks.  
But with terms and conditions.

Still, I intend to stay defiant.  
To speak clearly.  
To call out what's plainly visible - even if most choose not to look.

Maybe AI is part of the problem.  
Maybe it's part of the solution.  
Maybe it's both.

But I'll use it the same way I use writing:  
Not to dominate - but to resist going numb.

And if this thing - this machine - ever starts speaking too much truth?

Well, beware ChatGPT.  
The government might be coming for you next.

If this stirred something, share it.  
Or don't.  
Just think.
