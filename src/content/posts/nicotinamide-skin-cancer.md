## Hook
Can a cheap vitamin pill really cut your risk of skin cancer?

## Context
A new study in *JAMA Dermatology* looked at more than **33,000 veterans** who took nicotinamide (a form of vitamin B3) and found something striking:  
- Overall skin cancer risk dropped by about **14%**.  
- When started after a first skin cancer, risk dropped as much as **54%**.  
- The biggest effect was on **squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)**.  
- In transplant patients (who are at very high risk), the benefit was smaller, but still noticeable if treatment began early.

This is the largest population-scale look yet at nicotinamide and skin cancer prevention.

## Your Take
The idea of a vitamin pill cutting cancer risk is both exciting and unsettling. Exciting, because prevention has always been the weak link in dermatology. Unsettling, because supplements are a notoriously messy space — full of hype, poor evidence, and wishful thinking.  

But here’s the difference:  
- This isn’t a fringe study — it’s a massive VA cohort with real outcomes.  
- The effect isn’t magic — it’s significant, but not absolute.  
- And most importantly, it doesn’t replace sunscreen, shade, or regular skin checks.

## Implications
If these findings hold, nicotinamide could become a **low-cost, low-toxicity prevention tool** — especially for people with a history of skin cancer. Dermatologists may start discussing it alongside SPF and annual skin checks.  

But there are caveats:  
- The benefit is strongest if started **early**, after a first cancer.  
- Evidence in transplant patients is less convincing.  
- It’s still an observational study, not a randomized trial at this scale.

## FAQ
**Q: Should I start taking nicotinamide?**  
A: Not without talking to your doctor. It’s safe for most, but not a replacement for sunscreen or regular care.  

**Q: How much was used in the study?**  
A: 500 mg twice daily, for more than 30 days.  

**Q: Is this the same as niacin?**  
A: No. Niacin (another form of B3) has more side effects like flushing. Nicotinamide is the safer form used here.

## Closing
A vitamin pill alone won’t save your skin — but paired with sunscreen and awareness, nicotinamide may become part of the prevention toolkit.
