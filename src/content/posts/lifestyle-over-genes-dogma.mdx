## Hook

“Genes don’t matter. Just eat better.”

It sounds empowering.  
It also quietly turns into moralism: if you age badly, you must have failed.

And now we have a problem: the genetics story wasn’t actually disproven.

It was blurred by history.

---

## The Comfortable Narrative

Lifestyle-first messaging won because it’s:
- actionable
- compatible with public health campaigns
- emotionally satisfying (control feels good)
- politically safer than genetic determinism

Genetics, by contrast, sounded fatalistic — even when it was simply describing biology.

---

## The Measurement Problem Nobody Wanted to Lead With

Most longevity studies used historical cohorts dominated by extrinsic deaths:
- infections before modern medicine
- accidents and workplace hazards
- violence and war

When you treat those deaths as “aging,” you dilute the signal you’re trying to measure.

That pushes heritability down and makes it look like genetics barely matter.

---

## What the New Evidence Forces Us to Admit

Once extrinsic mortality is accounted for, intrinsic lifespan looks far more heritable — on the order of ~50–55% in the new analysis.

That doesn’t erase environment. It reframes it.

Environment still matters — but it often works by modulating biology, not replacing it.

---

## The Real Risk of “Lifestyle Over Genes”

When a narrative becomes dogma, it distorts priorities:
- we over-focus on behavior as identity
- we under-invest in mechanisms of aging
- we treat biology like an excuse instead of a target

---

## Closing

We didn’t reject longevity genetics because it failed.

We rejected it because it was culturally inconvenient.

That era is ending.

## FAQ

**Q: Are you arguing lifestyle doesn’t matter?**  
A: No. I’m arguing we’ve overstated “lifestyle explains everything” because lifespan measurement mixed extrinsic hazards with intrinsic aging.

**Q: Isn’t genetics talk deterministic and harmful?**  
A: It can be if misused. But avoiding genetics doesn’t protect people — it can mislead them about what’s actually driving risk and decline.

**Q: What’s the key concept to understand before arguing about this?**  
A: The difference between extrinsic and intrinsic mortality. Start here: [Intrinsic vs Extrinsic Mortality](/guides/intrinsic-vs-extrinsic-mortality).
