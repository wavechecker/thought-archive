## Hook

For more than three decades, the U.S. vaccinated **every newborn** against hepatitis B within 24 hours of birth.

This week, that universal recommendation ended.

Globally, almost no one else is changing course.

---

## What Changed in the U.S.

The CDC approved a revision to the childhood immunization schedule that:
- removes the **universal** birth-dose recommendation
- keeps immediate birth dosing when the mother is hepatitis B–positive or status is unknown
- allows delayed timing for infants born to hepatitis B–negative mothers

This isn’t a toxicity story. It’s a policy story.

## The global context (the part headlines skip)

<StratBox
  title="Why the Hepatitis B Birth Dose Exists"
  items={[
    "Infants infected at birth are far more likely to develop chronic hepatitis B than adults",
    "Chronic hepatitis B can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer decades later",
    "Maternal screening + documentation can fail; the birth dose is a backstop",
    "Global guidance tends to prioritise redundancy over optimisation"
  ]}
/>

Worldwide:
- many countries still run a **universal birth dose** strategy
- WHO guidance continues to emphasize early protection, especially where prevalence is moderate/high or system gaps exist

## U.S. vs EU vs WHO-world (simple comparison)

| Region / System | Typical approach | What it assumes |
|---|---|---|
| **United States (2025)** | Risk-based birth dose | Strong screening + strong follow-up |
| **EU/EEA** | Mixed (targeted in some, universal birth dose in a few) | Policy varies with prevalence + infrastructure |
| **WHO “default” global strategy** | Universal birth dose emphasized | Systems fail sometimes — plan for it |

## FAQ (reader-facing)

**Q: Is the hepatitis B vaccine still recommended for children?**  
A: Yes — the debate is about *timing*, not whether kids should be vaccinated.

**Q: Why do so many countries keep the birth dose?**  
A: Because early infection is uniquely consequential and early protection is uniquely effective — and because systems aren’t perfect.

**Q: Is a negative maternal test a guarantee?**  
A: It lowers risk a lot, but it doesn’t eliminate real-world failure modes (late care, errors, missing records).

## Closing

The U.S. didn’t discover something new about hepatitis B.

It decided it trusts its infrastructure more than its safeguards.

Most of the world still doesn’t.
