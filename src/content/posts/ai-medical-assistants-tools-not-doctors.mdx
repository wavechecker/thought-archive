## Hook

Large language models can identify the correct condition in ~95% of structured medical test scenarios.

Put them in the hands of real people?

Performance drops below 35%.

That’s not a glitch.

That’s a systems warning.

## Context

A 2026 *Nature Medicine* randomized study tested 1,298 UK adults using GPT-4o, Llama 3, and Command R+ for medical self-assessment.

When evaluated alone, the models performed strongly.

When used by real participants:

- Relevant conditions were identified in fewer than about one-third of cases  
- Correct triage decisions hovered around ~43%  
- Performance was no better than standard internet search  

The failure wasn’t medical knowledge.

It was human–AI interaction.

## The Wrong Question

We keep asking:

> “Is AI as smart as a doctor?”

That’s the wrong question.

The right question is:

> Can ordinary people use this tool safely under uncertainty?

Medicine isn’t a multiple-choice exam.

It’s incomplete information.
Stress.
Ambiguity.
Risk filtering.

And that’s where the breakdown occurred.

## What Actually Failed

The study exposed three consistent failure points:

### 1) Incomplete information

Users didn’t provide all relevant details (onset, severity, associated symptoms, risk factors).

### 2) Differential overload

Models generated multiple plausible causes.  
Users struggled to identify which one was dangerous.

### 3) Interpretation error

Even when a correct condition appeared in the conversation, users didn’t consistently act on it.

The models passed the exam.

The interaction failed.

## Tools, Not Doctors

LLMs are cognitive amplifiers.

In informed hands, they:

- Generate differential diagnoses  
- Surface red flags  
- Help structure thinking  
- Improve preparation for clinician visits  

In untrained or emotionally distressed hands, they:

- Create false reassurance  
- Encourage premature closure  
- Inflate trivial explanations  
- Produce misplaced confidence  

A chainsaw is powerful.

In trained hands, it builds.
In careless hands, it injures.

LLMs belong in that category.

## Why This Matters for Policy

Developers and regulators often rely on:

- Medical licensing exam benchmarks  
- Simulated patient interactions  
- Controlled test performance  

This study showed those methods do **not** reliably predict real-world safety.

If AI is going to be deployed as a “front door” to healthcare, it must be evaluated:

- With real users  
- Under incomplete information  
- Under uncertainty  
- Measuring under-triage (false reassurance) as a core safety outcome  

Exam scores are not safety evidence.

## The Responsible Path Forward

The answer is not abandonment.

It’s maturity.

AI in healthcare must be:

- Structured  
- Constrained  
- Explicit about risk  
- Designed to highlight red flags first  
- Tested with real humans before scaling  

AI is a tool.

And tools require skill.

## Closing

The models passed the medical exam.

The public failed the interaction.

That gap — between capability and safe use —  
is where healthcare AI will either mature responsibly…

or cause harm through overconfidence.
