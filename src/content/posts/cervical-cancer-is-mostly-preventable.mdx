## Hook

We know what causes cervical cancer.  
We know how to detect it early.  
We even know how to prevent most cases.

And yet—it still kills.

---

## The Failure Isn’t Medical

Cervical cancer persists because of:
- Missed screening
- Confusion over testing
- Poor access to care
- False reassurance from “feeling fine”

Symptoms arrive late. Prevention works early.

---

## Vaccines and Screening Work — Quietly

Countries with strong HPV vaccination and screening programs are already seeing steep declines in cervical cancer rates.

The tools exist.  
The gap is implementation.

---

## Why This Still Matters

Cervical cancer disproportionately affects:
- Women with limited healthcare access
- Migrant and marginalised populations
- Older women who stopped screening too early

This is a systems problem—not a mystery.

---

## Closing

Cervical cancer is not inevitable.  
It’s preventable—if systems work and people are informed.
