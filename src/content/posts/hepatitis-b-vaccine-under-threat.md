## Hook
In Alaska in the 1970s, hepatitis B was a death sentence. Entire Native communities saw infection rates as high as 15%. Children as young as 18 died of liver cancer before adulthood. Then a vaccine arrived — and within a decade, new childhood cases were virtually wiped out.  

That public health miracle is now under threat.

## Context
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s vaccine panel is reportedly preparing to **roll back or delay the hepatitis B shot for newborns**.  
On paper, it sounds procedural. In practice, it risks undoing one of the most successful vaccination programs in history.  

- In **Alaska**, universal vaccination ended childhood liver cancer in Native tribes.  
- In **Taiwan**, a nationwide program in the 1980s saw liver cancer in children fall by 70%.  
- In **Australia**, vaccination and maternal screening programs cut transmission to newborns by more than 95%.

## Why It Matters
Hepatitis B is a **“silent killer.”** It often causes no symptoms until cirrhosis or liver cancer appears years later.  
Without vaccination, entire generations risk being quietly infected, only to face catastrophic illness in middle age.

## Call-out Box
> **Hepatitis B by the Numbers**  
> - 300 million people live with chronic infection worldwide.  
> - 820,000 die each year — mostly from cirrhosis or liver cancer.  
> - In the US, cases among children fell by **>99%** after universal vaccination began in 1991.  
> - In Alaska Native communities, **childhood liver cancer disappeared** after vaccination.

## Your Take
Nobody likes needles. And it’s easy for anti-vaccine talking points to frame every shot as a risk. But hepatitis B is different.  
- It spreads silently, through blood, sex, or from mother to child.  
- It causes cancers that kill in painful, preventable ways.  
- The vaccine is safe, effective, and has decades of data behind it.  

Rolling back newborn vaccination doesn’t just invite more infections. It gambles with lives — the lives of children who won’t even know they were infected until it’s too late.

## Implications
This debate isn’t just about hepatitis B. It’s about whether hard-won public health victories can survive in an age of spin and conspiracy.  

The science is clear. The vaccine works. The risk is real.  
We can’t afford to forget why hepatitis B vaccination was one of the greatest public health achievements of the last half-century.

## Closing
Hepatitis B vaccination ended childhood liver cancer in Alaska. It could — and should — keep protecting children everywhere. Rolling it back isn’t just risky. It’s reckless.
