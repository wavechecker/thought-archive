## Hook

What if many psychiatric diagnoses aren’t separate diseases at all — but **different surface expressions of shared biology**?

A major cross-disorder genetics paper in *Nature* suggests that might be closer to the truth than psychiatry’s current labels imply.

---

## Context: When Biology Doesn’t Respect Diagnostic Boundaries

The study analyzed genetic data across **14 psychiatric disorders** using very large GWAS datasets. Instead of finding 14 cleanly separated genetic signatures, the researchers found the data clustered into **five underlying genomic factors** that explained most of the shared genetic liability across diagnoses.

This matters because psychiatry is built on a diagnostic structure that is reliable at describing what clinicians observe — but often weak at explaining *why* those symptom patterns happen.

---

## The DSM Problem: Descriptive, Not Mechanistic

The DSM is a **descriptive** framework. It was designed to:

- standardize diagnosis across clinicians
- define syndromes using symptom checklists
- support research, services, and insurance coding

But it was never built to be a map of biology.

So when genetics shows that conditions with separate DSM criteria share substantial risk architecture, that is not a minor technical detail — it’s a structural mismatch:

- **DSM categories describe outcomes**
- **genetics starts to reveal mechanisms**

---

## Why Comorbidity Is the Rule (Not an Exception)

Clinically, many people carry multiple diagnoses over time: depression + anxiety; PTSD + depression; eating disorders + OCD traits; bipolar disorder with psychosis.

The DSM treats this as “comorbidity” — multiple co-occurring conditions.

But a cross-disorder genetic model suggests a different interpretation:

> Many so-called distinct disorders may share upstream vulnerabilities, with symptoms diverging downstream.

That makes comorbidity less mysterious and more expected.

## What This Could Mean for Treatment

If shared biology cuts across diagnoses, then borrowing treatment approaches across diagnostic lines becomes more than an improvisation — it becomes *rational*.

This is already happening in practice:

- Trauma-focused approaches sometimes help subsets of “treatment-resistant” depression.
- SSRIs span depression, anxiety, OCD, and PTSD-related symptom clusters.
- Mood stabilizers and antipsychotics get used across a blurry mood–psychosis spectrum.

The genetics doesn’t “prove” any specific regimen — but it strengthens the argument that **the treatment target should increasingly be the disrupted system**, not just the label.

A useful reframe is:

> Treatment resistance can mean “wrong target,” not “difficult patient.”

---

## From Labels to Pathways

Instead of asking only:

> “Which DSM box fits best?”

An emerging model asks:

> “Which systems look dysregulated in this person?”

Examples include:
- stress / threat circuitry
- compulsive habit loops
- excitatory–inhibitory signaling balance
- neurodevelopmental wiring vulnerability
- reward and addiction pathways

Different labels can reflect the same underlying system — and the same system can present differently depending on development, environment, and context.

---

## Important Limits (No Hype)

This does **not** mean:
- genetic testing can currently match people to medications
- one drug will treat many disorders
- diagnoses are obsolete

It does mean:

> The DSM describes *what we see*.  
> Genetics starts to explain *what’s going wrong*.
