## Hook
First it was a crime. Then it was a cure. Now it’s a “use disorder.”  
Cannabis has traveled the full arc of modern medicine’s control loop — from demonization to diagnosis — and the irony is almost complete.

## Context
When the United States formally defined *Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD)* in the DSM-5, it wasn’t describing a new disease. It was describing behavior that already existed — using a plant, sometimes heavily, sometimes habitually.  
The label was a bureaucratic bridge: a way to move cannabis from the world of vice to the world of clinics. But it also locked the plant inside the same medical machinery that pathologizes half of modern life.

## Your Take
The trouble isn’t that cannabis can’t be harmful — it can be, especially with chronic high-THC use or adolescent exposure.  
The trouble is that we’ve built a culture that can’t tolerate *ordinary dependency.*  
If you rely on an SSRI to stay level, you’re “in treatment.”  
If you rely on cannabis to sleep or think or feel less raw, you’re “disordered.”  
Both involve chemical dependence. The difference is institutional approval.

The medicalization of cannabis may have been inevitable once legalization arrived. Doctors needed a gatekeeping role; regulators needed codes and categories.  
But the shift comes with a cost: it reframes normal human struggle — pain, anxiety, boredom, grief — as symptoms to be medicated. What began as liberation risks ending as bureaucracy.

## Implications
Cannabis is now a mirror for our larger unease with self-regulation. We no longer trust ourselves to decide what’s therapeutic, what’s escapist, and what’s simply human.  
The danger isn’t addiction — it’s outsourcing our self-understanding to diagnostic manuals.  
Medicalization tames stigma but also absorbs freedom; it trades one kind of control for another.

## Closing
We wanted cannabis to be accepted. It was.  
Now the question is whether we can keep it — and ourselves — from being over-diagnosed in the process.
