## Hook

At some point in the last decade, **eating well stopped being discipline and started being treated as a diagnosis**.

Care about food quality?  
Avoid junk consistently?  
Say no without apology?

There’s now a term for that: *orthorexia*.

And the way it’s used should make us uneasy.

---

## Context

Orthorexia is commonly described as an “obsession with healthy eating.”

What’s often omitted is a critical fact:

**Orthorexia is *not* recognised in the DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders).**

There are:
- no formal diagnostic criteria  
- no agreed thresholds  
- no objective biomarkers  

Despite this, the label is used freely — in media, therapy spaces, and online discourse — often **without demonstrating actual medical or psychological harm**.

That’s not a minor oversight.  
It’s the entire problem.

## The Problem With the Frame

Most behaviours associated with “orthorexia” are not extreme.  
They are **rational responses to a metabolically unhealthy food environment**:

- avoiding ultra-processed food  
- limiting sugar and refined carbohydrates  
- prioritising protein and whole foods  
- reading labels  
- cooking at home  
- declining foods that reliably cause fatigue, weight gain, or inflammation  

None of this is disordered.

What’s changed isn’t the behaviour — **it’s the baseline**.

When poor diet is normalised, **self-regulation starts to look radical**.

## Where the Concept Slips

Instead of asking:

> *Is this person healthier?*

the question quietly becomes:

> *Is this person flexible enough to keep others comfortable?*

Boundaries get reframed as “rigidity.”  
Consistency becomes “obsession.”  
Opting out becomes “avoidance.”

At that point, the standard is no longer health outcomes —  
it’s **social compliance**.

That isn’t medicine.  
It’s cultural enforcement dressed up as concern.

## A Counter-Guide: Defending Disciplined Eating

Disciplined nutrition is not about purity, fear, or moral superiority.

It’s about **predictable inputs producing predictable outputs**.

### Disciplined eating looks like:
- improved biomarkers and body composition  
- stable energy, mood, and sleep  
- strength and metabolic resilience  
- rules that *simplify* rather than multiply  
- flexibility when context genuinely requires it  

### Actual dysfunction looks like:
- rules that endlessly tighten  
- fear replacing curiosity or experimentation  
- worsening health despite “cleaner” eating  
- shrinking social and psychological bandwidth  
- food becoming identity, control, or virtue  

Same foods.  
Different direction.

## Why the DSM Point Matters

If a behaviour isn’t formally recognised as a disorder, then **calling it one should require evidence of harm — not social discomfort or non-conformity**.

Without clear criteria:
- discipline gets mistaken for pathology  
- health-conscious people second-guess themselves  
- broken norms escape scrutiny  

In a population drowning in diet-driven disease, this inversion is not neutral.  
It’s dangerous.

## FAQ (Quick Scan)

**Q: Is orthorexia a real medical diagnosis?**  
A: No. Orthorexia is not recognised in the DSM and has no formal diagnostic criteria.

**Q: Can eating “too healthy” actually be harmful?**  
A: Yes — but harm must be demonstrated (nutrient deficiency, declining health, severe anxiety), not assumed from food choices alone.

**Q: How do you tell discipline from dysfunction?**  
A: Outcomes. If health, energy, and life capacity improve, it’s discipline. If they worsen, something is wrong — regardless of the label.

**Q: Why is the term controversial?**  
A: Because it’s often applied based on social friction and norm-violation rather than medical evidence.

## Closing

Eating well is not a disorder.

Refusing a broken food culture isn’t obsession.  
Setting boundaries isn’t fear.  
And discipline shouldn’t require a diagnosis to be respected.

> **If health looks extreme,  
the baseline is the problem — not the person.**

When discipline is framed as pathology,  
the culture has already surrendered.
