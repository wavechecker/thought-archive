## West Nile is back — and it’s spreading

West Nile virus infections are spiking in the U.S. this year, with late summer and early autumn driving most cases. But this isn’t just a local blip. West Nile is part of a **global pattern**: mosquito-borne viruses are thriving in more places, for longer parts of the year, as climates trend **warmer, wetter, and more erratic**. Whether these shifts are primarily natural cycles or human-driven, the practical result is the same — **mosquito ecology is changing**, and viruses are following.

## What makes West Nile different
- **Wildlife reservoir:** WNV cycles between **birds and mosquitoes**. Humans are **dead-end hosts** (we get sick but don’t pass it on).
- **Mostly mild — sometimes severe:** Many infections are silent; a small fraction lead to **neuroinvasive disease** (encephalitis, meningitis, paralysis).
- **Seasonal risk:** Late summer/early fall peaks, especially after warm, wet periods (or even droughts that concentrate birds and mosquitoes around limited water sources).

## The wider pattern
- **Dengue & Zika:** Human-amplified outbreaks, expanding beyond the tropics as *Aedes* mosquitoes move into new regions.
- **Yellow fever & Japanese encephalitis:** Wildlife reservoirs (monkeys; birds/pigs) keep risk alive; vaccination programs are key where available.
- **Ross River virus:** Wildlife cycle (kangaroos, wallabies, birds) — climate and rainfall strongly influence outbreaks.

## Why climate matters (whatever the cause)
- **Warmer temps** → faster mosquito breeding and viral replication.
- **Heavy rain/floods** → more standing water (breeding sites).
- **Droughts** → birds, animals, and mosquitoes cluster together.
- **Range expansion** → mosquitoes establish in areas once too cool.

## What you can do
- Use **EPA-registered repellents** (DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus).
- **Long sleeves/pants** at dusk and dawn; use **window/door screens**.
- **Remove standing water** (gutters, pots, birdbaths); cover rain barrels.
