<Callout type="warning">
Strict keto isn’t automatically healthy — long-term zero-carb eating can impair insulin sensitivity, gut function, and hormonal balance.
</Callout>

Going “full keto” can feel empowering at first. Weight drops, energy rises, cravings disappear.  
But when carbohydrate intake falls too far for too long, the body adapts — and sometimes, not in good ways.

---

### ⚙️ 1. Keto works — until it doesn’t
Low-carb eating lowers insulin and improves blood sugar control.  
However, extended carb elimination can trigger a **physiologic insulin resistance**: muscles become resistant to glucose on purpose, saving what little sugar remains for the brain.  
If carbs are suddenly reintroduced, blood sugar can spike sharply — *mimicking* type 2 diabetes patterns.

---

### ⚠️ 2. Micronutrient and fiber shortfalls
Strict keto often limits:
- **Magnesium, potassium, and folate** (legumes, leafy greens)
- **Vitamin C and antioxidants** (fruit, capsicum)
- **Prebiotic fiber**, which maintains gut-microbiome diversity

Without these, fatigue, cramps, constipation, or low immunity may develop over time.

### 🔄 3. Metabolic rigidity
Remaining in ketosis indefinitely can blunt thyroid output, reduce leptin signaling, and lower resting metabolic rate.  
This means fat loss plateaus, cold sensitivity increases, and energy wanes.

---

### 💡 4. The balanced alternative
A **low-carb, whole-food approach** achieves similar insulin benefits *without* the downsides:
- Include fibrous vegetables (spinach, broccoli, mushrooms, green beans)  
- Add potassium-rich foods (avocado, lentils, capsicum)  
- Rotate small fruit portions (banana pre-workout, berries post-workout)  
- Keep protein high and fats moderate

### 🩺 Key takeaway
> Keto is a tool, not a lifestyle.  
> Sustainable metabolic health comes from variety, micronutrient sufficiency, and regular eating patterns — not permanent carb elimination.
