## Hook
COVID-19 showed us what vaccine inequity looks like in real time: wealthy nations secured early doses while many poorer countries waited months or years. The same pattern echoes across polio, measles, and other preventable diseases.

## Context
Vaccine equity means fair access across all populations, not just those with money or political power. The WHO estimates that more than one billion people worldwide still lack timely access to essential vaccines.  
Barriers are both structural (supply chains, cold storage, financing) and social (conflict, mistrust, misinformation).  

## Your Take
Equity isn’t charity — it’s security. Leaving large parts of the world unprotected is a recipe for new outbreaks, emerging variants, and prolonged pandemics.  
Initiatives like Gavi and COVAX have helped, but they can’t fix systemic dependence on donor nations and a handful of manufacturers. Long-term solutions require local production, sustainable financing, and community trust.  

## Implications
- **For wealthy nations:** Supporting vaccine equity reduces the global spread of disease and future pandemic risks.  
- **For low- and middle-income countries:** Strengthening health systems and building regional manufacturing capacity are essential for independence.  
- **For all of us:** Equity is both a moral obligation and a practical necessity — because pathogens don’t respect borders.  

## FAQ
**Q: Has COVAX solved the problem?**  
A: It improved access but struggled against supply constraints and vaccine nationalism.  

**Q: Why should wealthy countries care about equity?**  
A: Infectious diseases cross borders; outbreaks anywhere threaten global security.  

**Q: What’s the long-term fix?**  
A: Sustainable health systems, regional vaccine manufacturing, and financing models that don’t collapse after donor fatigue.

## Closing
Vaccine equity isn’t a side issue — it’s the backbone of global health security. Until every country has the tools to protect its people, no country is truly safe.
