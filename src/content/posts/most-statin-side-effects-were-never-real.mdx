## Hook

For years, statins have been blamed for everything from memory loss to depression to kidney failure.

Now the largest safety analysis ever done says: **most of that was never true.**

---

## Context

A new meta-analysis published in *The Lancet* examined adverse effects attributed to statins using only large, double-blind randomized trials.

- 154,000+ participants  
- 23 trials  
- Median follow-up ~5 years  

This design eliminates expectation bias and confounding that dominate observational safety data.

---

## What the study found

Out of 66 adverse effects listed on statin labels:

- Only **four** showed a statistically credible signal
- Absolute risks were **small**
- Most feared effects showed **no causal relationship**

## Why this matters

After high-profile statin scare stories in the early 2010s, prescription data showed a sharp rise in treatment discontinuation.

Subsequent analyses estimated thousands of avoidable cardiovascular events.

Fear wasn’t neutral.  
It caused harm.

---

## The deeper issue

If benefits require randomized evidence, harms should too.

Listing speculative side effects:
- Undermines trust
- Amplifies nocebo effects
- Pushes patients off life-saving therapy

---

## Closing

This study doesn’t claim statins are perfect.

It shows that medicine has been arguing about the wrong risks — and patients paid the price.
