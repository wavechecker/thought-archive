# Global Snapshot: COVID-19 Vaccine Guidance in 2025

The debate over COVID-19 vaccination looks very different depending on where you stand.  
While the U.S. has entered a full-scale clash between **AAP, CDC, and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.**, other countries have taken quieter, more conservative approaches.

---

## Australia (ATAGI)

- **Healthy children under 18** — *not recommended*.  
- **Children with medical risk factors** — eligible, annual boosters.  
- **Adults 75+** — boosters every 6 months.  
- ATAGI has not shifted in response to U.S. controversies; guidance remains stable and risk-based.

---

## Canada (NACI)

- **Children 6 months–4 years** — two-dose Moderna regimen if unvaccinated, but mainly emphasized for *immunocompromised* or *medically vulnerable*.  
- **Additional doses** for immunocompromised children.  
- **No blanket recommendation** for healthy kids.  
- NACI continues to back both mRNA and protein-subunit vaccines for broader use, but keeps pediatrics risk-focused.

---

## United Kingdom (JCVI)

- **Reversal since 2022**: universal 5–11 rollout withdrawn.  
- **Healthy young children** — eligible for at most a single dose, not a series.  
- **High-risk kids** — still offered vaccination.  
- Emphasis is on protecting the vulnerable, not mass pediatric uptake.

---

## United States (CDC vs AAP)

- **CDC:** Shared decision-making for healthy kids; no broad recommendation.  
- **AAP:** Strong recommendation for children 6 months–2 years, and optional for older kids.  
- **HHS Secretary RFK Jr.:** Warning doctors about liability if they diverge from CDC, sparking legal and political fights.

---

## The Takeaway

- **Australia, Canada, UK:** Conservative, risk-based, cautious with pediatric recommendations.  
- **United States:** An outlier — divided, politicized, and now legally contested.  

This divergence underscores a new reality: there is **no global consensus** on how to handle COVID-19 vaccination for children. Instead, national approaches reflect not only science and risk, but also politics, trust, and institutional battles.
