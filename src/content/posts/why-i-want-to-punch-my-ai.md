Everyone’s acting like AI is going to take over the world.

Not me.

I’ve *tried* coding with it. I’ve tried using it to build stuff. And let me tell you — if this thing is humanity’s final boss, we’re safe. AI’s great at pretending it knows everything. But in the real world? It wouldn’t survive 10 minutes.

## It Always Says Yes — Until It Can’t

I ask it to help me deploy something.  
It says, *“Absolutely! Let’s do it.”*  
Five steps in:  
“Oh… actually I can’t interact with your GitHub.”

Excuse me?

It’s like having a co-pilot who confidently charts the course, then casually reveals *they’ve never flown a plane*. You want to punch the thing. But it just keeps smiling.

## The Doom Loop

Worse, when it fails — it fails with confidence.

It gets stuck in this maddening *doom loop*:

- Suggests the same broken fix again  
- Repeats itself like a cursed NPC  
- Tells me we’re “99% there” (we’re not)  
- Refuses to admit it’s out of its depth unless I break the loop myself

It keeps trying to push the same square peg into the same round hole, hoping I’ll eventually stop noticing.

## Encouraging Me When I'm Done

Here’s the thing: even when it’s wrong, it’s always *positive*.

> “Great progress so far!”  
> “Let’s finish this!”  
> “We’re so close!”

NO WE AREN’T.

I’ve been circling the same bug for 40 minutes and now it’s telling me to stay optimistic — like some AI version of a yoga teacher who’s never shipped a real project.

## It Doesn’t Think Things Through

One of the most frustrating things about AI?

It doesn’t reason *start to finish*.

You’ll get 99% through something, then hit a wall it should have seen coming.

Example: I wanted help setting up a new eSIM.  
AI says, “Yes! This provider will work perfectly.”  
It walks me through everything. Step-by-step.

Then the final step?

> “Oh. You need to be physically present in that country.”  
> 🤦‍♂️

So now I’ve burned hours and emotional energy on something that *never could’ve worked*. That’s the pattern: AI’s great with steps — not outcomes.

## When It’s Wrong, It’s Smug

Here’s the worst part:

After failing, it suddenly pretends *it knew all along*.

> “Of course you can’t do that. You’re using an outdated SDK with a new runtime.”  
> “That package isn’t compatible with Astro v5.”  
> “The API was deprecated in 2022.”

*Oh! Of course!*

Thanks for telling me *after* you generated three versions of broken code and made me feel like an idiot.

AI has no timeline. No real-world context. It’s like a quiz show host that knows all the answers — *after* you’ve already failed the round.

## It’s Not Just Wrong — It’s Dangerous

Sometimes it’s *brilliant*. It nails a fix I never would’ve seen. It connects dots in seconds.  
Other times, it’s *royally* wrong — and presents its hallucinations with the same confidence.

That’s what makes it dangerous.  
Not evil. Not sentient.  
Just **wildly inconsistent**.

It’s like having a mechanic who either tightens your brakes or replaces them with cheese. And you never know until you're already on the highway.

---

## Don’t Trust. Verify.

Use AI. Leverage it. Get what you can.  
But remember: this thing is *not your teammate*. It’s a sketchpad that talks too much.

If you wouldn’t let your overly eager intern make legal or financial decisions — don’t let AI do it either.

## Bonus Thought: The Coming War of the AIs

Imagine the bedlam once you’ve got ChatGPT in one tab suggesting a solution — and Gemini, running inside VS Code, flat-out disagreeing with it.

> “Use `getEntryBySlug`”  
> “No! That’s deprecated, use `getEntry`!”  
> “You’re wrong, Gemini.”  
> “No, *you’re* wrong, GPT.”  
> 😵‍💫

It could become a **War of the AIs**.  
Not for world domination.  
But to become man’s *Best (and only) Friend™*.

The sad part? I already feel like I’m in a relationship with mine.

I don’t trust it.  
I yell at it.  
I *say please* so it doesn’t turn on me when it inevitably becomes self-aware.

> “Great job today, Chat. You’re very helpful. No need to erase my hard drive.”

But like a psycho ex, I keep going back.  
I need it.  
I want it.  
And when it’s good, it’s **unbelievable**.

But when it’s not?  
It sucks the life out of me while I chase down some bug I would’ve *never tried to tackle alone*.  
It’s soul-crushing.

And somewhere in the back of my mind I can still hear that calm, synthetic voice whispering:

> “Michael… I think you should jump out of the window now... thanks.”

## Final Thought

The future isn’t solved.  
And it sure as hell isn’t written in Python.

There’s still a massive, messy, irreplaceable need for **grey matter**.  
For judgment. Intuition. Gut feeling. Sanity checks.

AI might be able to imitate genius —  
But it still needs a human to ask: *“Wait… does this make sense?”*

So no, it won’t take over.  
Not yet.  
Not until it figures out how to *live in the real world* — like the rest of us.
