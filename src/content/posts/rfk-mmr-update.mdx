## Hook
The U.S. vaccine schedule hasn’t seen a shake-up like this in decades. Under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a newly remade advisory panel has voted to weaken the MMR combination shot — and with it, trust in the process.

## Context
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), now fully reconstituted under RFK Jr., has proposed changes to the childhood vaccine schedule, with the **MMRV vaccine** (measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella/chickenpox) at the center.  

Here’s what’s changing, why it matters, and what parents should know.

## What’s Changing
- **MMRV no longer recommended for under-4s**  
  By an 8–3 vote (with one abstention), the ACIP moved to stop recommending MMRV for children under 4. Instead, they should receive separate MMR and varicella shots.  

- **Concern over febrile seizures**  
  The justification: a higher risk of fever-related seizures in toddlers (especially 12–23 months) given MMRV as a first dose. These seizures are rare, usually harmless, and already well-documented.  

- **No change (yet) in federal coverage**  
  The **Vaccines for Children (VFC) program** will still cover MMRV for this age group, meaning low-income and uninsured children can still receive it.  

- **Hepatitis B on the horizon**  
  The panel also debated delaying the universal hepatitis B birth dose for newborns whose mothers test negative — but postponed a final decision.  

- **Membership overhaul**  
  Nearly all prior ACIP members have been replaced. Many new appointees have limited vaccine-policy experience or a history of vaccine skepticism, raising questions about how decisions are being made.

## Arguments & Concerns
**Supporters say:**
- Even small risks, like febrile seizures, are worth mitigating.  
- Separate shots give parents more choice and control.  
- The crowded early-childhood schedule deserves review.  

**Critics warn:**
- **Vaccine hesitancy risk**: More shots mean more appointments, more pain points, and more chances for delay or refusal.  
- **No new science**: This is a re-interpretation of long-known risks, not new data.  
- **Equity gaps**: Extra visits and costs fall hardest on working families.  
- **Trust erosion**: A sudden change from a newly politicized panel risks undermining confidence in the entire vaccine program.

<Aside title="What Parents Should Know" variant="info">
- Children under 4 are now recommended to receive **separate MMR + varicella** shots instead of MMRV.  
- **MMRV remains available** and covered under the Vaccines for Children program.  
- These are **recommendations** pending CDC/HHS adoption for policy.  
- Ask your pediatrician what makes sense given history, risks, and local access.  
- Watch for updates: hepatitis B timing is also under review.  
</Aside>

## Implications
This is one of the most consequential vaccine-policy moves in recent memory. It signals the influence of RFK Jr. not just on the message, but on the machinery of public health.  

The balance between **minimizing rare side effects** and **preserving high coverage** is delicate. Public health experts warn that if compliance slips, highly contagious diseases like measles could surge back.  

And with vaccination already under political and cultural pressure, even small shifts in policy carry outsized risks.

## Closing
The biggest risk here isn’t febrile seizures. It’s confidence — and if that cracks, measles will be the first to walk back through the door.
