# COVID-19 Vaccination Guidelines in Australia (2025)

*See also: [The mRNA Vaccine War Isn't Over — Pediatrics Just Drew a New Line](/posts/mRNA-vaccine-war-pediatrics-2025)*

Australia's approach to COVID-19 vaccination has diverged from the U.S. and Europe in 2025.  
While the **American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)** now recommends vaccination for all children 6–23 months, Australia has taken a far more conservative stance.

## Children and Adolescents

- **Healthy infants, children, and adolescents under 18**  
  **Not recommended** to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, unless they have medical conditions that increase their risk of severe disease.  
  Rationale: severe illness in this group remains extremely rare.

- **Children with medical risk factors**  
  Eligible—and in some cases recommended—to receive COVID-19 vaccines, including **annual boosters**.  
  Risk factors include immunocompromise, chronic conditions, or significant disability.

- **Infants/toddlers (<5) with medical risk**  
  Eligible for vaccination, but only under clinical advice.

## Adults

- **Adults 75+** — booster every 6 months.  
- **High-risk adults (18–74)** — annual booster.  
- **Healthy adults under 65** — not routinely recommended, but optional.

---

## Key Context

- ATAGI reaffirmed its stance in April 2025: vaccines are important for high-risk adults, but **healthy children should not be vaccinated**.  
- Previous provisional approvals (like Comirnaty for 5–11 year olds with risk factors) remain in place.  
- Vaccine uptake has dropped sharply in children overall, with the federal government drafting a **new immunisation strategy** to restore trust.  

---

## Comparison with the U.S.

- **AAP (U.S.)**: Recommends vaccination for all children 6–23 months.  
- **ATAGI (Australia)**: Advises against vaccination for healthy children under 18.  

This divergence highlights a growing global reality: there is **no longer a unified consensus** on how to handle pediatric COVID-19 vaccination.
