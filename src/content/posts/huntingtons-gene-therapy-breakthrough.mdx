## Hook
What if a single brain surgery could buy years of extra independence from one of the cruelest genetic diseases we know?

## Context
This week, *Nature* reported that a one-time gene therapy slowed Huntington’s disease by **75% over three years** in early-stage patients. The trial was small — just 29 people — but it’s the strongest evidence yet that we can finally change the trajectory of this disease.  

## Your Take
We’ve been here before. Antisense therapies once promised the same, only to fail in late-stage testing in 2021. That’s why this trial, run by **uniQure**, feels different: it directly targets the gene with a **viral delivery of microRNA**, essentially muzzling the faulty protein at its source.  

Still, let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Surgery is invasive, the data unpublished, and 29 people is barely a starting point. But for families who’ve watched loved ones lose control of their bodies and minds with no hope in sight, this is more than a headline. It’s proof of possibility.  

## Implications
If confirmed, this therapy could redefine how we treat not just Huntington’s, but other repeat-expansion brain disorders. Regulators will scrutinize the data in 2026. For now, patients and clinicians are left with hope — tempered by caution, but hope nonetheless.  

## FAQ
**Q: Why does this matter now?**  
A: Because it’s the first real evidence of slowing the disease, not just treating symptoms.

## Closing
A disease once seen as unstoppable might finally be meeting its match. The question now: can we make hope scale?
