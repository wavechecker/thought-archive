## Hook
More than **1,600 Americans** have caught measles this year — the most since 1992.  
How did a virus declared “eliminated” a generation ago come roaring back?

## Context
The CDC’s latest report tallies **1,618 confirmed cases** across **42 jurisdictions**, with **43 distinct outbreaks** — a **six-fold increase** from 2024.  
Roughly **96% of infections** occurred in unvaccinated or unknown-status individuals.  
Hotspots include **Texas**, **New York**, and several **Midwestern states** where local vaccination rates have slipped below herd-immunity thresholds.

## Your Take
This outbreak is a warning shot.  
For decades, measles existed mostly in textbooks — a proof of public-health success. Now, it’s a stress test for **trust, policy, and memory**.

- **Trust**, because misinformation has eroded vaccination confidence in pockets of the U.S.  
- **Policy**, because pandemic-era disruptions left “immunity gaps” that were never fully repaired.  
- **Memory**, because the lived memory of measles — the fevers, hospitalisations, and deaths — has faded.

The result: communities once protected are becoming islands of susceptibility. The virus only needs one traveler and one cluster of unvaccinated people to ignite an outbreak.

## Implications
For most of the U.S., overall immunity still keeps population risk low — but the trendline matters.  
If coverage dips below ~95%, measles regains a foothold. It also shows how fragile elimination status can be, even in wealthy countries.  

Public-health teams are racing to contain outbreaks with contact tracing and catch-up vaccination campaigns. The CDC stresses that **two doses of MMR remain ~97% effective**, and there’s no sign of viral mutation reducing vaccine efficacy.

## FAQ
**Q: Should Americans worry about nationwide spread?**  
A: Widespread resurgence remains unlikely, but localized outbreaks can grow quickly where vaccination coverage is low.

**Q: What can individuals do?**  
A: Verify you’ve had **two doses of MMR**; adults born after 1957 without records should get vaccinated or tested for immunity.

**Q: Are travelers affected?**  
A: Yes. Measles importations from abroad continue to seed U.S. outbreaks; proof of immunity is recommended before international travel.

## Closing
Diseases don’t need passports — only opportunities.  
The measles comeback isn’t just about a virus; it’s about whether modern societies can keep the simplest promise of all: **protection that lasts.**
