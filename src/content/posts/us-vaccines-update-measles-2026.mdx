## Overview
Vaccine policy in the United States has entered a period of rapid change. Federal leadership shifts, revised CDC guidance, and renewed comparisons to European vaccination models have coincided with a measurable rise in measles cases.

While policy debates continue, infectious disease dynamics are already responding.

    "Reframing of some childhood vaccines away from universal recommendations",
    "Greater emphasis on shared clinical decision-making",
    "Public comparison to lower-intensity European schedules"

## Why Denmark Is Being Referenced
Denmark is frequently cited because it uses a more limited routine childhood vaccine schedule while maintaining high public trust and strong healthcare access.

However, structural differences matter:
- Smaller population
- More uniform healthcare coverage
- Fewer under-vaccinated pockets

Directly importing policy language without accounting for these differences carries risk.

## Measles: Early Warning Signal
Measles is among the most contagious human viruses. Even small drops in vaccination coverage can trigger outbreaks.

<RiskBox

  risks={[
    "Airborne transmission",
    "High attack rate in unvaccinated populations",
    "Rapid spread before public health response can scale"
  ]}
/>

Recent outbreaks have overwhelmingly involved unvaccinated or under-vaccinated groups, reinforcing long-established epidemiology rather than introducing new uncertainty.

## What This Means Practically
Policy language may change faster than clinical practice.

Most pediatricians, infectious-disease specialists, and state-level school requirements continue to rely on established immunization science, particularly for measles protection.

---

## Key Takeaway
Political frameworks can shift quickly. Viral transmission does not.

Measles resurgence is not hypothetical — it is already occurring.
