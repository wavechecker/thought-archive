## Hook
There’s a simple test for whether the *GLP-1 revolution* has begun:  
Walk into any pharmacy, gym, office kitchen, or WhatsApp group — someone is on **Ozempic**, knows someone on Ozempic, or is arguing about Ozempic.  

It’s the closest thing modern medicine has to a cheat code.

## Context
For decades, weight loss advice was built on blame: *eat less, move more*.  

Then the data came in.  
Semaglutide (Ozempic/Wegovy) and tirzepatide (Mounjaro/Zepbound) didn’t just outperform diets — they **obliterated** them.  
We’re talking **10–22% body weight reductions**, improved insulin resistance, reduced liver fat, lower inflammation, better sleep apnea scores, reductions in blood pressure and cholesterol.

The most common feedback?  
> “For the first time in my life, I’m not hungry.”

That’s not a fad. That’s a neuro-endocrine rewrite.

## Your Take
Here’s my view:  
GLP-1 medications don’t just work — **they expose how broken our food environment and metabolic landscape really are**.

People aren’t weak.  
Ultra-processed food is engineered to override human biology.  
GLP-1 drugs simply give people their biology back.

But there’s a darker side too:  
- supply shortages  
- rising global demand  
- muscle loss in people who don’t train  
- unknown long-term economics  
- the philosophical question: *Should millions rely on a weekly injection for life?*

We’re in uncharted territory.  
This isn’t keto or intermittent fasting — this is a pharmaceutical shift at civilization scale.

## Implications

### 1. Healthcare systems will reshape around GLP-1s
Obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and fatty liver disease are huge burdens. GLP-1s cut deep into that curve.

### 2. Food companies will quietly panic
If millions spontaneously lose interest in junk food, the effects ripple through agriculture, marketing, and retail.

### 3. Gyms will see a new type of member
People who never felt capable of training now do.  
If paired with resistance work, the results can be life-changing.

### 4. Metformin will have a renaissance
As a safe, cheap insulin sensitizer, it’s the perfect partner for GLP-1s — and an alternative for mild metabolic dysfunction.

### 5. A moral debate is coming
Should governments subsidise GLP-1s?  
Should healthy people be allowed to use them?  
Should we treat obesity like any other chronic disease?

### 6. A fork in the road for individuals
These drugs can be a catalyst — or a crutch.  
The difference comes down to lifestyle:  
**protein, resistance training, sleep, steps, and long-term habits.**  
The injection helps you *eat less*, but only you can decide what you build on that foundation.

## FAQ

**Q: Will people need these drugs forever?**  
A: Some will, some won’t. Biology varies. But without lifestyle change, regain is likely.

**Q: Are we heading toward “compulsory” weight loss?**  
A: No. But expect insurers, employers, and governments to push GLP-1 use for high-risk groups.

**Q: Are these safe long-term?**  
A: Current data is strong, but 20-year outcomes don’t exist yet.

## Closing
Like it or not, we’re living through a metabolic turning point.  
This isn’t just a new drug — **it’s one of the biggest shifts in human appetite since agriculture**.

The question is no longer *“Does Ozempic work?”*  
It’s *“What do we do with a world where it does?”*
