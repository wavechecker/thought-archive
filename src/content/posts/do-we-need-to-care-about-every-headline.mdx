## Hook
The U.S. wants to split the MMR vaccine into separate shots. Again.  
And honestly? I can’t bring myself to care.

<OutbreakBox dataKey="measlesUS" year={2025} />

## Context
Every few months, a new “controversy” bubbles up in health news. It rarely signals a scientific shift — just a change in what editors think will spark clicks.  
One week it’s masks. The next it’s vitamins. Now, it’s whether measles, mumps, and rubella deserve their own vials.

The science hasn’t changed. The fatigue has.

## Your Take
It’s not apathy — it’s triage.  
We’re drowning in noise, and even people who care deeply about health can’t engage with every recycled debate.  

When headlines keep re-litigating settled science, they erode trust rather than strengthen it. Each flare-up siphons energy from the problems that actually *are* changing: new pathogens, global immunization gaps, collapsing public-health funding.

Maybe it’s okay — even necessary — to stop reacting to every tremor. To ask: does this story change practice, or just posture?

## Implications
Learning when *not* to care is a form of health literacy.  
Attention is finite, and the outrage economy runs on stealing it.  
By choosing where to focus, we keep room for the stories that matter — the slow, structural shifts that never trend but shape everything.

## FAQ
**Q: So should I ignore headlines about vaccine policy?**  
A: No — but read them for signal, not shock. Ask: is this a new policy, a data change, or just a political echo?

**Q: Isn’t disengagement dangerous?**  
A: Blind trust is dangerous. Blind outrage is too. Discernment sits in the middle.

## Closing
The world doesn’t need more instant opinions. It needs fewer, better-timed ones.
