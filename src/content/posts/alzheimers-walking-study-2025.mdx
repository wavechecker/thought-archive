## Hook
Even a few thousand daily steps may help the brain resist Alzheimer’s disease for years longer, according to new research in *Nature Medicine*.

## Context
The study followed 296 adults aged 50–90 in the **Harvard Aging Brain Study** over 14 years. None had symptoms at baseline, but some showed early Alzheimer’s markers (amyloid-β) on brain scans. Participants wore pedometers to track daily movement.

## Findings
- **3,000–5,000 steps/day** delayed measurable cognitive decline by roughly **3 years**.  
- **5,000–7,500 steps/day** slowed decline by **up to 7 years**.  
- Benefits plateaued above 7,500 steps.  
- The effect appeared **only in people with high amyloid levels**, suggesting exercise may buffer the transition from amyloid buildup to tau pathology and memory loss.

## Why It Matters
The “10,000-step” target isn’t necessary for brain health. For older adults at risk of Alzheimer’s, achievable daily movement — walking to the shop, gardening, or short strolls — could meaningfully preserve cognition.

Researchers think regular movement boosts **blood flow, insulin sensitivity, and BDNF** (a growth factor that supports neuron repair), while improving the brain’s ability to clear toxic proteins.

## Quote
> “Even a little bit of exercise seems to help,” said Dr. Wai-Ying Wendy Yau, Harvard Medical School memory specialist and study co-author.

## FAQ
**Q: Does walking help if I already have Alzheimer’s symptoms?**  
A: The strongest effect was seen in people *before* symptoms appeared, but moderate exercise remains beneficial for overall brain and vascular health.

**Q: Do I need 10,000 steps?**  
A: No. The benefit plateaued above 7,500 steps — meaning “some is better than none,” especially for older adults.

**Q: What kind of walking counts?**  
A: Brisk daily walks, even broken into 10-minute bouts, provided measurable benefits.
