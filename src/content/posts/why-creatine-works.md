## Hook
I used to think creatine was for gym bros.  
Then I read the research — and realized it might be the simplest longevity hack hiding in plain sight.

## Context
Somewhere between quitting smoking, lifting weights again, and trying to lose visceral fat, I stumbled on the fact that creatine isn’t just about muscle size.  
It’s about **cellular energy** — the same ATP your brain and heart rely on to keep you alive and sharp.

Hundreds of peer-reviewed studies now show creatine helps not just athletes but middle-aged adults, vegetarians, and even people with metabolic or mood issues.  
It buffers fatigue, sharpens memory, and helps your body make better use of glucose.

## Your Take
When you hit midlife, you stop bouncing back like you used to.  
Workouts feel heavier. Recovery drags. Sleep isn’t as deep.  
That’s where creatine quietly shines — restoring your *cellular currency* so your body can keep performing.

After a month on 5 g/day of plain monohydrate, I noticed subtle but real changes:  
- Better recovery  
- More stable energy  
- Stronger lifts  
- Sharper focus  

And no — it’s not placebo. The science is stacked too deep for that.

Creatine, protein, and strength training form a simple metabolic triangle:
> **Lift → Eat → Recover → Repeat**

Nothing exotic, no secret biohack. Just consistency.

## Implications
This is one of those rare cases where the hype matches the evidence:
- Costs less than coffee.  
- Has the safest record in sports nutrition.  
- Builds strength, cognition, and metabolic resilience at any age.  

If you’re over forty and want to burn fat, protect muscle, or just feel sharper — this is low-hanging fruit.  
Start with a barbell, a walk, and a scoop of creatine. The rest follows.

## FAQ
**Q: Isn’t creatine just water weight?**  
A: Early on, yes — muscles pull in water, but that’s part of the performance benefit.  

**Q: Do I need to cycle it?**  
A: No. Daily use (3–5 g) keeps levels steady and safe.  

**Q: Does it mix with caffeine?**  
A: Perfectly fine — take it whenever fits your routine.

## Closing
If there’s a supplement that deserves a permanent place next to your coffee mug, this is it.  
Three grams a day. Every day. That’s the whole play.
