# AAP–CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Guidance Dispute (2025)

In August 2025, the **American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)** recommended routine COVID-19 vaccination for children aged 6 months to 2 years, diverging from the **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)**, which supported "shared decision-making" between parents and physicians. [source]

Following the announcement, **Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.** stated that liability protections under the **1986 Vaccine Injury Act** might not extend to physicians who follow AAP recommendations instead of CDC guidance. [source]

Legal scholars including **Dorit Reiss (UCSF)** and **Anna Kirkland (University of Michigan)** rejected the claim, stating that liability coverage is tied to federal legislation and excise taxes, not professional society recommendations. [source]

## International comparison
- **Australia (ATAGI):** Vaccination not recommended for healthy children under 18, except those at risk. [source]  
- **Canada (NACI):** Limited use for young children, with emphasis on medically vulnerable groups. [source]  
- **United Kingdom (JCVI):** Routine vaccination withdrawn in 2022; only high-risk children eligible. [source]  

## Reception

The AAP defended its independence, stating that its immunization recommendations were rooted in peer-reviewed science. [source]
