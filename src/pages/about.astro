    <h1>About PatientGuide.io</h1>

    <h2>Our mission</h2>
    <p>
      PatientGuide.io exists to make medical information clearer, calmer, and
      more useful. We translate clinical evidence into plain-language guides so
      patients can better understand their health and have more informed
      conversations with their clinicians.
    </p>

    <h2>What we aim to do</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Explain conditions, tests, treatments, and health concepts in straightforward language</li>
      <li>Present evidence honestly — including what is uncertain or debated</li>
      <li>Help readers know what questions to ask and what to expect</li>
      <li>Organize information into structured, easy-to-navigate guides</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What we do not do</h2>
    <p>
      PatientGuide.io is not a substitute for professional medical advice,
      diagnosis, or treatment. We do not:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide personal medical recommendations</li>
      <li>Tell you what treatment to choose</li>
      <li>Replace the judgment of a qualified clinician who knows your history</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you have a medical concern, please consult a healthcare professional.
    </p>

    <h2>Editorial independence</h2>
    <p>
      Our content is written and reviewed independently. We do not accept
      industry funding that could influence what we publish or how we frame it.
      If that ever changes, we will disclose it clearly on every affected page.
