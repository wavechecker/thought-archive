    <h2>Educational purpose</h2>
    <p>
      PatientGuide.io provides health information for educational purposes only.
      The content on this site is intended to help readers better understand
      medical topics — it is not a substitute for professional medical advice,
      diagnosis, or treatment.
    </p>

    <h2>No clinician–patient relationship</h2>
    <p>
      Using this site does not create a clinician–patient relationship. Nothing
      published here should be interpreted as a personal recommendation for any
      individual. Always consult a qualified healthcare professional for
      decisions about your health.
    </p>

    <h2>Accuracy and limitations</h2>
    <p>
      We make reasonable efforts to ensure our content is accurate and
      up to date, drawing on peer-reviewed research and clinical guidelines.
      However, medical knowledge evolves and we cannot guarantee that every
      statement reflects the most current evidence at all times.
    </p>
    <p>
      PatientGuide.io, its authors, and contributors are not liable for any
      harm, loss, or decision made based on information found on this site.
      You use this site at your own discretion.

      and are not responsible for the content, accuracy, or availability of
      third-party sites.
