    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      PatientGuide.io is designed to respect your privacy. We collect as little
      data as possible and do not track you across the web.
    </p>

    <h2>Analytics</h2>
    <p>
      We use <a href="https://www.goatcounter.com">GoatCounter</a>, a
      privacy-friendly analytics tool. GoatCounter does not use cookies, does
      not collect personal data, and does not track you across sites. It records
      basic, anonymous page-view data (such as page URL, referrer, browser type,
      and screen size) to help us understand how the site is used.
    </p>

    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>
      PatientGuide.io does not set tracking cookies. A small local-storage entry
      may be used to remember your theme preference (light or dark mode). This
      data stays on your device and is never sent to a server.
    </p>

    <h2>Medical data</h2>
    <p>
      We do not collect, store, or process any personal health or medical
      information. PatientGuide.io is an educational resource — there are no
      user accounts, health profiles, or diagnostic tools that capture your data.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-party services</h2>
    <p>
      The site loads fonts from Google Fonts, which may log standard web request
      data (IP address, browser type) under Google's own privacy policy. No
      other third-party services are used to track visitors.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>
      If you have questions or concerns about privacy, please reach out via the
      <a href="/contact">Contact page</a>.
