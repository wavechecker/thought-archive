# AI access

PatientGuide.io publishes evidence-based health guides and posts.
This page describes the canonical routes and machine-readable endpoints available for programmatic consumption.

## Canonical content routes

| Route | Description |
|---|---|
| `/guides/` | All published health guides |
| `/posts/` | Editorial posts and commentary |

Individual items are available at `/guides/{slug}/` and `/posts/{slug}/`.

## Machine-readable endpoints

Two API endpoints expose guide metadata without requiring HTML parsing:

### JSON (full catalogue)

```
GET /api/guides.json
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
```

Returns an object with `generatedAt` (ISO timestamp), `count`, and an `items` array.
Each item includes `id`, `slug`, `title`, `description`, `summary`, `keyPoints`, `category`, `tags`, `publishDate`, `updatedDate`, and `url`.

### NDJSON (streaming / line-delimited)

```
GET /api/guides.ndjson
Content-Type: application/x-ndjson; charset=utf-8
```

One JSON object per line with the same fields as above.
Suitable for streaming parsers and line-by-line processing.

Both endpoints are cached for 15 minutes (`Cache-Control: public, max-age=900`).

## Recommended parsing structure

Each guide typically follows this section order:

1. **Intro** --- opening paragraphs that frame the topic.
2. **Key Points** --- a concise bulleted summary (also available as `keyPoints` in the API).
3. **FAQ** --- structured question-and-answer pairs when present.
4. **Further Reading** --- links to primary sources, guidelines, and references.

The `summary` field provides a short plain-text synopsis.
When a guide does not define an explicit summary, the `description` field is used as the fallback.

## Date format

All dates are serialised as ISO 8601 strings in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (e.g. `2026-02-19`).
`publishDate` is always present; `updatedDate` is included when the guide has been revised after initial publication.
