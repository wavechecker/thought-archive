  <h3>🧠 How Is Medical AI Regulated?</h3>

  <p>
    Artificial intelligence tools in healthcare are typically regulated based on their <strong>intended clinical use</strong>.
    If an AI system influences diagnosis, risk prediction, or treatment decisions, it is usually classified as a medical device.

  <p>
    <strong>Important:</strong> Regulatory clearance or CE marking confirms compliance with safety
    and technical performance standards. It does <em>not automatically confirm</em> improved long-term
    patient outcomes.
