  <h3>Why do statin labels list so many side effects?</h3>

  <p>
    Many adverse effects listed on statin drug labels were added based on
    observational studies, case reports, or post-marketing surveillance —
    not randomized trials.
  </p>

  <p>
    These data sources are vulnerable to expectation bias, especially for
    common symptoms like fatigue, pain, or memory complaints.
  </p>

  <p>
    Large double-blind randomized trials remain the most reliable way to
    determine whether a drug truly causes an effect.
