  <p>
    Stroke treatment has improved significantly — but speed is still critical.
  </p>

  <p>
    Doctors now rely less on rigid time cut-offs and more on brain imaging and
    clinical assessment. This means:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>More patients are eligible for treatment</li>
    <li>Some people can be treated even if they arrive later than before</li>
    <li>Emergency response remains the most important factor</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    You do not need to know which treatment applies. Getting to hospital quickly
    gives doctors the best chance to help.
